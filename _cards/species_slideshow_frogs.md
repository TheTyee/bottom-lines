Three-quarters of Canada’s reptiles (including **Massasauga rattlesnakes**, **Queensnakes**, and **Box** and **Spotted turtles**) and a third of its amphibian species (including **Leopard frogs** and **Tiger salamanders**) are considered either “at risk” or “sensitive” to loss. **Leatherback sea turtles** are endangered on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
