**2011**: For over ten years, since 1999, the federal government has known that it lacked enough environmental information “to understand the combined impact of [oil sands] projects in the lower Athabasca region and the impact on ecosystems… including the wider Mackenzie Basin of the Northwest Territories. In the absence of this information, it is impossible to track environmental changes over time…[L]ittle was done for almost a decade to close many of those key information gaps."

Canada is also failing to enforce the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Environment Canada doesn’t know which entities or activities pose the greatest threats, and so cannot target its enforcement at the greatest risks to human health and the environment. The department is also unaware of whether its enforcement is improving compliance or reducing the threat of environmental damage.
