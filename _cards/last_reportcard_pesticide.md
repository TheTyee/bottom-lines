**2003**: Progress is “slow” in re-evaluating older but widely used pesticides against contemporary health and environmental standards. Given that all the pesticides so far reevaluated have either been pulled from the market or seen restrictions placed on their use, and that others scheduled for reevaluation remain for sale, the commissioner finds that, “it is likely that some of them do not meet today's standards.”
