> "The public needs to have access in a timely manner to all information pertaining to the health of the Great Lakes and efforts to restore and protect the ecosystem. Scientific data must be translated into information that is readily accessible and understood by decision-makers and local watershed groups. Transparency and accessibility must also be key features in the decision-making process. A Great Lakes office or
government information service must make information readily accessible to the public."
