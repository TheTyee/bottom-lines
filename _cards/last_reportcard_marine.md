**2012**: Canada is far behind in meeting its 15-year-old commitment to complete a network of Marine Protected Areas. Protected areas have been set aside in only two of 29 “representative” marine ecosystems, representing just one-tenth of the country’s 2010 promise to protect 10 per cent of Canada’s marine areas.
