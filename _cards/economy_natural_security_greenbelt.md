Toronto’s Greenbelt, which stretches around the west end of Lake Ontario and north along the Niagara escarpment to Lake Huron, is worth $2.7 billion a year to the province’s residents in measurable ecosystem services. Valued services include farmland, recreational areas, water collection and air-quality improvement, as well as carbon storage.
