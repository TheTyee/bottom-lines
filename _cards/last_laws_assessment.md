<h4>1992</h4>

<p>Introduced and passed by a Conservative government in 1992, and brought into force three years later by its Liberal successor, the <b>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</b> (CEAA-1992) provided a new mechanism to prevent industrial development from harming the environment. Previous laws didn’t come into play until the environment was already damaged. CEAA required that project impacts be examined in the light of other federal laws that protect species at risk, fisheries, migratory birds and protected areas, and provides for aboriginal consultation.</p>

<h4>Since 2012</h4>

<p>The CEAA-1992 is repealed and replaced. The new <b>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012</b> sharply restricts which projects will be assessed and expands the discretion of political ministers to limit what impacts are reviewed. The new CEAA also limits the right to participate in public review hearings. The legislation also transfers environmental assessment of pipeline projects to the National Energy Board, and of nuclear projects to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, while making their decisions subject to federal cabinet confirmation or reversal.</p>
