> The federal government’s lack of leadership in protecting drinking water quality has resulted in troubling information gaps such as the lack of a comprehensive registry of drinking water threats, trends and indicators—such as boil water alerts. Canada’s National Water Policy Institute has warned of the threat from climate change to Canada’s water supply, which the current federal government is studiously ignoring.
