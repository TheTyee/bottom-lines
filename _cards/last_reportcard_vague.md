**1993**: Ottawa is implementing plans to improve water quality in the Great Lakes, B.C.’s Fraser River, and the Atlantic coast. The first two are “producing some positive results.” Lacking however is “a federal framework of desirable water quality objectives for the major ecosystems across Canada,” that would assure the public that they are achieving their objectives. “The federal government needs to know where it is going and how it is going to get there.”

Source: the office of Environment Commissioner, created in 1995, is a branch of the auditor general’s office.
