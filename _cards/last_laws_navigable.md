#### Then (1882)
Originally passed in the early years of Confederation as the **Navigable Waters Protection Act**, this law extended federal oversight by default to any Canadian stream big enough to float a canoe. In recent decades it provided a trigger for the environmental assessment of proposals that disrupted waterways that support fish. 

#### Since 2012
An omnibus budget bill renames the law as the **Navigation Protection Act**, and restricts its protection to identified waterways considered significant to navigation. The narrowed scope allows engineering or construction to impact wildlife or navigation on 99 per cent of Canada’s rivers and small lakes without notice or federal review. The Minister may not later order any such construction removed. The new Act also withdraws federal oversight of navigational impediments in listed waterways: provinces, municipalities and private citizens may take offenders to court.
