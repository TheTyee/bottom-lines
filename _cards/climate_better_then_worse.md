Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2004, but their decline since then has stalled. Levels in 2012 were 40 per cent above Canada’s target for that year under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, [link to footnotes?] (targets that were abandoned [link to footnotes?] in 2011), and 14 per cent above the new target for the year 2020 that Canada adopted in Copenhagen [link TK] in 2009.
