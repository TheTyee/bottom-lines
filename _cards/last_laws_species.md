<h4>2002</h4>

<p>Passed in 2002 and put into force two years later <b>The Species At Risk Act</b> (SARA) enacts Canada’s commitments under the 1993 International Convention on Biological Diversity. SARA makes it an offence to kill, harm, harass or capture an individual of a listed endangered, threatened, or extirpated species, or to damage or destroy the residence of an endangered or threatened species. Experts nominate threatened species to the Minister of the Environment for protection; the federal cabinet decides which to list for protection.</p>

<h4>By 2013</h4>

<p>The Commissioner of the Environment reports that Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Parks Canada, have failed to meet their legally mandated SARA targets to establish recovery strategies for threatened species. Only seven of 97 required action plans are in place, and 146 recovery strategies remain incomplete. Of ‘completed’ recovery strategies, nearly half fail to identify the species’ critical habitat. Environment Canada has abandoned efforts to monitor biodiversity and, the Commissioner notes, “it is not clear how Canada will meet its biodiversity targets by 2020.”</p>
