> ”[W]e have very little information on what is actually happening, and … the availability, currency and quality of water data are far below what is required…. [T]here is a lack of baseline data on water use in Canada (or even agreement on what constitutes “use”). Estimates are based on models and coefficients that may no longer be appropriate. There is an imbalance between water quality and water quantity data. [W]hile the federal government used to monitor 4,000 sites, that number has declined to 2,500 sites and is still dropping. There is also no standardization and integration of data among jurisdictions. A lot of data are being gathered at the watershed level, often using differing data collection protocols, but the federal government has little knowledge of what is happening, who is doing what, or what the quality of information is.”
