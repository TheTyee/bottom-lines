> “Canada needs to make major advances in areas such as groundwater inventory, protection and research in order to achieve responsible and effective management of this important freshwater resource…. The federal government should include an assessment of the state of the groundwater environment in the next issue, and all future issues, of the ‘State of the Environment Report’ [discontinued after 1996].”
