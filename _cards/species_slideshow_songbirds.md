**Songbirds**: most species of grassland, shrubland and forest birds such as flycatchers, swallows and warblers have shown sharp declines since the 1970s; some species such as the **Eastern meadowlark** have lost three-quarters of their populations. One-third of Canada’s shore-bird species, such as **sandpipers**, have experienced “significant” declines since the 1980s. Changing climate, resulting in changes in the appearance of prey food, may be behind the decline of **puffins, eider ducks, ivory gulls** and other seabirds.
