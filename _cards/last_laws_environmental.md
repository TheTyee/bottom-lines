<h4>1989</h4>

<p>Passed in 1989 and brought into force the following year, <b>Canadian Environmental Protection Act</b> (CEPA) replaces the Clean Air Act of 1971, the Ocean Dumping Control Act of 1973, and the Environmental Contaminants Act of 1976, and incorporates provisions in the Canada Water Act limiting the release of organic nutrients that encourage ‘dead zones’ in lakes.</p>

<h4>1999</h4>

<p>Amendments bolster federal CEPA authority to act against a broad range of environmental concerns, from toxic substances to environmental emergencies. A new schedule lists toxic controlled substances and controls what, and how much of a substance may be imported to Canada. Enforcement powers include fines and imprison­ment for company officers and directors if they fail to take all reasonable measures to ensure compliance.</p>

<h4>Since 2012</h4>

<p>A new Environmental Enforcement Act increases penalties under CEPA and other federal environmental legislation. New provisions introduce mandatory mini­mum fines and dramatically higher maximum fines. These may be doubled if a person is convicted of an offence a second or subsequent time. Large-revenue corporations will pay more than smaller businesses. </p>
