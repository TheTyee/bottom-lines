> The late 1990s have witnessed a decrease in flood risk management capacity by all levels of government. At a time when high quality information is needed to meet the challenge of achieving sustainable human settlement and development, the level of information to assist decision making has declined. Between 1995 and 1998, budget allocations for the hydrometric network were reduced by 35 percent. Federal and provincial programs have also been slashed, resulting in a reduction of governments’ professional capability in water management and flood control.
