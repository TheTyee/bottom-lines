**2013**: Canada’s national parks are fraying at the ecological seams from a variety of threats. The government has developed policies to reverse the erosion in the health of the nation’s parks, but “key elements” are missing, including “a scientifically credible system for monitoring ecological integrity.” Parks Canada has not explained how, and by when, in light of cuts to its budget, “it will address the backlog of unfinished work, the emerging threats to ecological integrity, and the declines it has identified in the condition of many park ecosystems.”

Canada has protected migratory waterfowl (largely ducks and geese significant to hunters) well, but has largely failed other species Canada has committed to protect. “[S]ome bird populations—shorebirds, grassland birds, and aerial insectivores—are in major decline.” For a third of Canadian bird species, “monitoring is insufficient to determine whether they are at risk.” 

Canada is failing to properly manage its protected areas. Plans exist for only 46 of 54 such areas, and Environment Canada itself rated 90 per cent of these inadequate in 2011.
