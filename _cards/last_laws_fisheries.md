#### Then (1868)
One of Canada’s oldest statutes, the Fisheries Act was passed into law by Canada’s first Parliament in 1868. For nearly 140 years, it was a backbone of legal protection for marine species. The law rests on the federal government’s Constitutional jurisdiction over Canadian fisheries. The Act prohibited causing damage to or contaminating the adult or spawning habitat of all fish. 

#### Since 2012
Amendments included in an omnibus budget bill drop fish habitat from the Act’s coverage, and limit its protection to only those species of commercial, aboriginal or recreational importance. They also permit the federal government to surrender its Constitutional responsibility to protect fish to the provinces, and to exempt some waterways entirely from the Act’s protection.
