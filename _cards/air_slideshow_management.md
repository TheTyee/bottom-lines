> “The adequacy of information available to water managers varies across provinces and watersheds. Watershed managers and provincial policy-makers need adequate data and information to support the decisions they make since monitoring and measuring tasks are critical to achieving management goals. But in many cases, these data are not available, or are not in a usable form. Priorities for data collection, and adequate budgets for such collection, need to be set.”
