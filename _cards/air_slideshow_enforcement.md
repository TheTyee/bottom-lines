> “A hodgepodge of incomplete data, or no data at all. Enforcement data under different federal environmental laws is … gathered using inconsistent methods. Very limited information identifying environmental offenders, incident location, and the exact nature of the violation (specific substance, quantities, etc.) is disclosed to the Canadian public. Industry compliance rates across all environmental laws are also not made public. These gaping holes in environmental enforcement data leave Canadians with almost no way to determine whether these laws are achieving their respective goals of conserving wildlife species and habitat and protecting the marine environment."
