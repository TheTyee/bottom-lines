> “[A]ccurate data on water use is unavailable. Due to limited, dated information … regarding water availability (surface and groundwater) and industrial water use on regional and national scales, the sustainability of the country’s water resources becomes a question. If Canada is to fully understand water use now and into the future, a comprehensive picture of actual usage across the country is necessary. This in turn must be paired with other monitoring data to ensure ecosystem flows are accounted for.”
