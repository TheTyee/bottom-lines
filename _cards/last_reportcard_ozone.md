**2000**: A ten-year-old federal/provincial plan has failed to contain ground-level ozone smog, (nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds). The federal government did most of what it had promised to do, but provincial “good intentions [were] never implemented as originally envisioned.” The commissioner reminds Parliament that the federal government has a duty to ensure its collaborations with provinces and territories effectively protect the public from environmental risk.
