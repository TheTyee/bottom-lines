#### Researchers have cracked the code to work out nature’s dollar value to the economy

It’s an old economic truism, a corollary of the law of supply and demand, that scarcity creates value. In an era when natural capital is disappearing, it is also increasingly highly valued. Canada’s ineffective stewardship of its ecological assets puts at risk hundreds of billions, potentially trillions, of dollars worth of wealth, in addition to intrinsic and cultural values.

Economists have estimated that the ecological services provided by the Mackenzie River watershed in northern Canada are worth some $571 billion a year—thirteen and a half times the region’s official GDP of $42 billion. ^83 In 2014 an unknown portion of that wealth went up in smoke, when fires consumed vast swaths of boreal forest. Soot from the fires in the Northwest Territories drifted downwind to darken Greenland’s ice sheets, hastening their melt. ^384

The anecdote illustrates how perceptions of environmental stewardship and risk have tightened over a quarter-century. Canadians feared for their natural security as long ago as 1989, when eight in ten of us agreed at least somewhat in surveys (and half of us, “strongly”), that pollution “threatens the survival of the human race.” ^360

The nature and extent of that threat are now much clearer, as is how much we stand to lose. 

The eco-systems that provide Canadians with their natural security, that sustain health and prosperity, are weakening and degrading. While some old hazards are in check, others have resurfaced and new ones are appearing in our air and water. ^372 Wildlife and landscapes deeply woven into Canadians’ identity are at more risk now than 25 years ago. ^366 ^394 And a quarter-century after Canada’s government endorsed cutting our annual greenhouse gas emissions to 472 MT within sixteen years, they are nearly one and a half times that, and will rise more by 2020 and beyond. ^283

If Canada has realized few of the good intentions embodied in its array of environmental legislation, research and experience have heightened our awareness of what’s at stake. Setting aside—though not discounting—the intangible cultural and spiritual values received from natural landscapes, the release of tension found in an urban park or remote campsite, and the moral “existence value” imputed to non-human creatures, close analysis has revealed with growing precision the measurable benefits that natural infrastructure provides to our dollar-denominated economy.

An early study, for example, estimated in 1996 that British Columbia received $2.75 billion a year (adjusted for inflation to 2014) in non-lumber value from its pre-pine-beetled forests, mainly from outdoor recreation, but also from wildlife viewing and recreational fishing and hunting. ^59

Investigators have since revealed the economic value of services that Ontarians derive from Toronto’s greenbelt: farmland, recreational areas, water collection and air quality benefits ring in at $2.7 billion a year. ^77 Toronto’s trees were revealed in a different study to be worth more than $80 million annually, in services that run from energy-saving shade to scrubbing pollutants from the air; that amount was more than the city spent in 2014 on economic development and recreation. The asset value of the urban forest was assessed at $7 billion. ^103

The value of climate-threatening carbon stored in Manitoba’s 50 million hectares of boreal forest was assessed in 2014 at $117 billion—10 times the province’s full budget—not counting recreation, hunting, and other economic contributions. ^101

Our peers and trading partners are moving beyond the outdated perspective that economic and natural security present a zero-sum dilemma, in which preserving the environment can only reduce prosperity. Policies increasingly recognize that the two are additive: that resilient, productive ecosystems also expand national and corporate bottom lines.

Some of these suggest practical steps for Canadians to consider, in order to reverse the erosion of our environmental advantage.

### Standards and accountability

It may be axiomatic that it’s impossible to manage what you don’t measure. Yet a recurrent complaint among experts is that Canada lacks the consistent and timely reporting of critical ecological variables, from snow depth to species populations, needed to support sound decisions. In the words of a joint federal-provincial study in 2010: "Information critical to the assessment of ecosystem health is missing." ^414

Nearly 50 European governments have countered their own impulse to overlook environmental decay by joining the Aarhus Convention. It commits them to gather and publish enough information about their national environment to establish its status. Anyone who believes a government is failing to do so, may request an arms-length investigation and ask national courts to compel compliance with any judgment that results. ^10

Near-term electoral rewards may tempt any democratic government to overlook long-term environmental losses in its decisions. Britain, India, Australia and the United States all broadly share Canada’s legal tradition, but have found at least a partial answer in a legal doctrine known as the “Public Trust.” ^428

Derived from Roman antecedents, it holds that governments have an inescapable duty to current and future citizens to protect certain natural features, especially related to water—and that citizens may ask the courts to force governments to meet that responsibility. Written into constitutions and simple legislation, the doctrine has obliged governments at all levels to improve their stewardship.

Canadians remain as concerned for the security of their air and water today as they were in 1989. Justifiably: new biological and synthetic toxic threats have emerged, and Canada continues to lack mandatory national air or water pollution limits.

The United States has had mandatory standards for air and water quality for over 40 years. Contained in the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, they are enforced on a county-by-county basis. ^386 ^387 Rules adopted in the European Union in 2007 require importers and manufacturers to replace the most toxic industrial compounds with more benign alternatives; the changes are expected to save the EU $4 billion a year in health costs. ^28

Other countries and some provinces have pioneered other effective approaches to better environmental stewardship: regulated water ‘markets’ (Australia and Alberta); watershed-based stewardship (France and, for more than seven decades, Ontario); taxes on carbon emissions (Britain, British Columbia) ^429; special courts that can order companies to compensate communities for lost eco-services (Mexico) ^430; and legal rights to a clean environment (Mexico and more than 110 other countries). ^431

There has been another transformative advance in the quarter century since 1989: plummeting technology costs now make it affordable for environmental managers to stay on top of complex and variable natural conditions in real-time. Examples can be found in southwestern Alberta and British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley where mounting water scarcity has prompted the development of highly sophisticated tracking systems that could prove models for the rest of the country. ^432

Only the Norse and the Swiss are more likely than Canadians to rank the environment as their country’s most important issue. ^355 The same world study that revealed that curious factoid however, also scored Canadians’ actual behavior as “green” consumers in 16th place among the 17 countries it examined—marginally above dead last.

The shortfall between the environmental aspirations we express as Canadians, and Canada’s achievements over the past quarter-century, is irrefutable. But it’s not inevitable. Effective models for action surround us. And the same 25-year perspective reveals that we have a fast-rising economic, as well as ecological, stake in the outcome.
