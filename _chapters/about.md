#### About the project

[Tyee Solutions Society (TSS)](http://tyeesolutions.org) is a Canadian non-profit society that uses traditional investigative journalism techniques and innovative presentations to provide citizens with the information they need to create positive change. Its previous work has included new approaches to aboriginal education, solutions for affordable housing, practical ideas for ‘greening’ Canada’s oil sands, and more.
 
This TSS project asked a deceptively simple question: Cutting through all partisan rhetoric, how well has Canada cared for its environment, really?
 
The result is a ‘just the facts ma’am’ record of the best answers we could find. To make our report the most objective one possible without conducting prohibitively expensive original science, we spent 10 months combing the most reliable publicly available sources: government documents, scientific papers, reports from independent international bodies, leading research and think-tank organizations.
 
To help overcome a potential bias toward only the most recent activities, we examined a full quarter-century of Canada’s environmental record—a period during which five Prime Ministers from three parties occupied 24 Sussex Drive. This method had some weaknesses. Some older and formerly public government reports have become difficult to obtain as a result of changes to archiving policy. Continuous records of key environmental variables are in any case few (as many of the reports we reviewed also observed). Some information simply did not exist in 1989. Evidence-based ranking of countries’ environmental stewardship dates only to 2000. In other cases time liberated information that might once have been locked behind proprietary walls—such as detailed polling results.
 
The search produced hundreds of individual records, across six environmental dimensions, covering the entire period chronologically. These records, with links to many of their sources, [can be found here](/references); we hope other researchers find them of use. We have made every effort to confirm the accuracy of each of these, but do not guarantee it all cases. For some earlier events, dates are best approximations. We will be grateful to have errors brought to our attention.
  
We ourselves draw no broader conclusion than this to the general question we were asked: “How well has Canada cared for its environment, really?” Sadly, not very well.
