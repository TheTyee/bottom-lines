#### About the project

[Tyee Solutions Society (TSS)](http://www.tyeesolutions.org) is a Canadian non-profit society that uses traditional investigative techniques and innovative technological approaches to provide citizens with the information they need to create positive change. Its previous work has included new approaches to aboriginal education, solutions for affordable housing, practical ideas for ‘greening’ Canada’s oil sands, and more.
 
This TSS project asked a deceptively simple question: Cutting through all partisan rhetoric, how well has Canada cared for its environment, really?
 
The result is a ‘just the facts ma’am’ record of the best answers we could find. To make our report the most objective one possible without conducting prohibitively expensive original science, we spent 10 months combing the most reliable publically available sources: government documents, scientific papers, reports from independent international bodies, leading research and think-tank organizations.
 
To help overcome a potential bias toward only the most recent activities, we examined a full quarter-century of Canada’s environmental record—a period during which five Prime Ministers from three parties occupied 24 Sussex Drive.
 
This method had some weaknesses. Some older and formerly public government reports have become difficult to obtain as a result of changes to archiving policy. Continuous records of key environmental variables are in any case few (as many of the reports we reviewed also observed). Some information simply did not exist in 1989. Evidence-based ranking of countries’ environmental stewardship dates only to 2000. In other cases time liberated information that might once have been locked behind proprietary walls—such as detailed polling results.
 
The search produced hundreds of individual records, across six environmental dimensions, covering the entire period chronologically. These records, with links to their sources, can be found here; we hope other researchers find them of use. We have made every effort to confirm the accuracy of each of these, but do not guarantee it all cases. For some earlier events, dates are best approximations. We will be grateful to have errors brought to our attention.
 
We are also grateful to the [Environmental Law Centre at the University of Victoria](http://www.elc.uvic.ca/) for its assistance in identifying and providing analysis of key legislative and judicial developments since 1989, and to [Evidence for Democracy](https://evidencefordemocracy.ca/) for data relating to government support for science.  We’ve made our research freely available for any individual or organization who finds it useful.
 
Chris Wood was the primary researcher on this project and wrote the main text. David Beers executive produced the project and edited the text. Phillip Smith and Alex Grunenfelder produced the project. Sarah Berman wrangled data into sharable graphs and slideshows. Michelle Hoar and Carra Simpson administered the project.
 
This report is novel not only in its examination of a full quarter-century of federal stewardship of the world’s second-largest land mass, but in being tailored from inception to reach Canadians in every way that they seek out knowledge in the 21st century. We hope it becomes a place where Canadians using any device can go for better answers to how well their country has cared for the environment.
 
We ourselves draw no broader conclusion than this to the general question we were asked: “How well has Canada cared for its environment, really?” Sadly, not very well.
