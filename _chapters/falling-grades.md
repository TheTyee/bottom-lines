#### When others grade our stewardship, Canada consistently falls short of its citizens’ aspirations

Nothing says ‘Canada’ quite like a scenic vista—be it Gros Morne, the Saskatchewan sky, or a whale breeching in the Salish Sea. Canadians are justly proud of the vast variety of our landscapes. Our pride and concern for our natural environment has been rock-steady over a quarter of a century. Only Swiss and Norwegian citizens are more likely than Canadians to identify the environment as their No. 1 political issue. ^355
 
Our leaders have appeared to be in step. Regardless of party, they have regularly assured us that Canada’s natural security is well protected. Legislation has been enacted  across an impressive range of fronts, from protecting species to penalizing polluters and preventing foreseeable harm.

Yet independent assessments and a candid account of our history tell quite a different story. Much of this country’s original wealth was created by logging forests for timber, breaking native prairie for grain fields, and blasting minerals from hard rock. The idea that environmental loss is a regrettable but necessary price for prosperity has been deeply ingrained. Last year, the Prime Minister argued against additional measures to preserve a stable climate by saying, “No country is going to take actions that are going to deliberately destroy jobs and growth in their country.”
 
That this conventional wisdom is wrong is one of the clearest signals to emerge from the past quarter-century. To the contrary, a growing body of evidence reveals the very large economic benefits that flow from healthy ecosystems, and the correspondingly high cost of their loss or disruption.
 
Significantly, as the value of the security these natural systems provide has come more sharply into focus since the turn of the century, Canada’s standing on environmental stewardship has slipped from near the top of the class among developed countries, to near or even at the very bottom. 
 
We examined the actions that Canada’s governments—of differing political stripes—have taken to protect and secure the environment since 1989, as well as the global context of those actions. Over the 25-year period to 2014, we found that state-of-the-art legislation to protect biodiversity, the safety of air and water, and critical natural systems, has never been fully implemented or effectively enforced. Numerous mandated goals remain unmet.
 
The consequences of bi-partisan neglect are now becoming apparent. Many supposedly ‘protected’ species are at greater risk today than they were in 1989. New and more elusive chemical threats have replaced older biological ones in Canada’s water—although some of the latter are also back with a vengeance.

Ambitious goals articulated a quarter-century ago to reduce Canada’s climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions have slipped by unmet. Our contributions to climate change have reversed a brief decline and are now again trending upward, even as its manifestations take a growing toll on livelihoods and structures.

Elsewhere, international investors and key agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund now question the conventional Canadian wisdom that expanding the economy is worth any price to the environment. Bodies that report on how well different countries’ maintain their natural security have made the same link.

### From ‘A’s to ‘F’s

Such rankings are only as old as the new century. One of the earliest was completed in 2000 as a pilot project for the World Economic Forum. Combining 64 indicators, the Yale Centre for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science ranked Canada 7th among 56 developed and developing countries.^12 In a more polished version the following year, Canada scored even better: third in a field of 122. ^14

But more critical assessments surfaced almost at once. In the same year that Yale and Columbia placed Canada third in the world, researchers at the University of Victoria called Canada’s environmental record, “one of the poorest of the industrialized countries." ^16 In follow-up comparisons, the same team ranked Canada 28th among 30 wealthy countries in 2005, and 24th of 25 in 2010. ^25 ^35

Other assessments have reached the same unflattering conclusion: against its developed peers, Canada trails. The United Nations Environment Program put us as low as 43rd in the world in environmental “vulnerability” in 2005. ^26 The business-oriented Conference Board of Canada scored us 15th among 17 countries in 2013. ^46

That same year the Centre for Global Development put us last in class for environmental care: 27th in a field of 27 rich, educated nations. ^48 And last year the Climate Action Network and a research partner again placed Canada at the very bottom of 58 countries whose climate protection policies they evaluated. ^357

### Not how we see ourselves

Our national decline in global stewardship rankings is at odds with Canadians’ priorities over the same years as captured in opinion polls, although these also reveal that we’ve long been skeptical that our governments were up to the job.

Back in 1989, more than four-fifths of Canadians polled by Environics Research agreed at least somewhat (and fully half felt so “strongly”) that pollution “threatens the very survival of the human race.” ^360 More than nine in ten of us were at least somewhat concerned about specific issues like acid rain, toxic chemicals, and air and water quality. Concern for wildlife followed closely. Climate change was on the minds of eight Canadians in ten even then.

At the same time, Canadians were roughly split on whether the federal government was doing a “fair” job protecting the environment, or a “poor” one. Four in ten nonetheless optimistically believed the environment would improve over the following decade.
A dozen years later, further research by the same company revealed that public concern about threats like toxic chemicals, water quality and wildlife, had hardly changed. ^361 Confidence in the federal government was up modestly: by 2001 more than half of Canadians felt it was doing a “fair” job; only 29% rated it “poor.”

The financial crisis that struck in 2008 dramatically changed Canadians’ priorities. The year before, polls had placed the environment in a statistical tie with health care as the country’s most important problem in citizens’ eyes. ^358 By the following year, it had dropped to a distant third, buried by worry over the economy. ^359

There has been a corresponding drop-off in pollsters’ interest in Canadians’ environmental views since then, but a handful of studies confirm that our concern hasn’t lessened.

Environics found in 2013 that more Canadians identified the economy than the environment as the country’s #1 issue just then. ^362 But when they considered the future, they saw the loss of our natural security as the greatest threat. Other research found that while Canadians’ have become more certain that human activity is causing climate change, their confidence in government to be the “lead actor” in response, has dropped.

In short: Canadians’ concern for the environment has changed little over 25 years. Governments claim to have taken effective action. Yet our grades are dropping. Below, we explore this paradox in detail.
