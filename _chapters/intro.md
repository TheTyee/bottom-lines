#### Our review covered Canada’s record on water, land and air, as well as species, ecosystems and climate change.

Canada enjoys the world’s second-largest landscape. Surely we can count on it for natural security: a healthy environment to support our well-being and prosperity long into the future. But can we?
 
We reviewed the facts over a quarter century. We looked at how governments led by five Prime Ministers and three political parties over twenty five years--from 1989 to 2014--have cared for the ecological assets that support Canada’s wealth and health. We sought original documents and independent reports, and ignored political spin. 

And here’s the Bottom Line: Canada’s natural security has been deeply degraded. Our review found persistent failures to meet environmental goals set in law or accepted under international treaties. Meanwhile, audits have revealed declines in the biodiversity that underwrites our natural security in every part of Canada, along with new as well as resurgent old threats to our health. 

The other clear lesson: the idea that natural security has to be sacrificed for prosperity is contradicted by the record. The facts reveal the very large contribution that thriving ecosystems make to our local and national economies beyond their deep values as treasured landscapes and iconic wildlife.
