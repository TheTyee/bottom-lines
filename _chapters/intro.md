#### Our review covered Canada’s record on water, land and air, as well as species, ecosystems and climate change.

In this era of stressed ecologies and climate instability, Canadians should be able to count on the world’s second-largest landscape for resilient natural security: a healthy environment to support both our well-being and our prosperity long into the future. But can we?
 
We reviewed the facts over a quarter century of federal environmental stewardship. Here, you can explore the record several different ways. The following pages tell the story of what Canadians have said they value most, and what worries them most, in our natural environment, as well as how our various governments have responded over the 25 year since 1989 and how effective those responses have been according to a wide variety of independent assessments. Throughout, you’ll find info-graphics and interactive text features that drill down deeper into particular subjects, from climate change to threatened species to economic impacts. Here and at the end of the text, you’ll also find the entire record of Canada’s environmental history over the period we reviewed—the key events, the important legislation and the report-cards scoring our standing in the world, along with much more—contained in six critical chronologies.
 
And the bottom line? Our review has revealed bi-partisan failures to meet Canada’s legal and international commitments, and a continuing decline of the healthy biodiversity that ensures our natural security. What’s also become clear is that the economic arguments used to rationalize our negligent stewardship are out of step with the growing awareness of just how much thriving ecosystems contribute to our national wealth and individual health, as well as deeply valued landscapes and Canadian wild life.
