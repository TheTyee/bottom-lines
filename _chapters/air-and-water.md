When Canadians were asked back in 1989 to name their biggest environmental concerns, the top three answers they gave were, in descending order: toxic chemicals, water quality, and air quality. [360] Four in ten were hopeful that things would improve within a decade.
 
Two and a half decades later, toxic chemicals, water and air quality are still among Canadians’ top concerns. [362] But whether those 1989-era hopes have been realized depends on where you look. Some former threats have receded, but others have taken their place. And a few banes that once appeared to be conquered are now back and more dangerous than ever.
 
An example is blue-green algae—a type of primitive phyto-plankton.  These can be dangerous as well as unsightly: when blue-green algae die and break down they release potent neuro and hepato-toxins, destructive to nerve and liver systems respectively. Contact can produce headaches, fever, abdominal pain, nausea and death. ^363
 
The primary cause of their summertime ‘blooms’ in lakes, oceans and rivers is an over-abundance of dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen—ingredients in farm and garden fertilizers that have the same powerful effect in the wild, ‘fertilizing’ the rapid growth of aquatic algae. The organisms flourish particularly well in water bodies depleted and warmed by a changing climate.
 
And such toxic blooms are spreading. ^364 ^365 Once banished from Lake Erie, blooms have returned to the shallowest Great Lake. Last summer, residents of the U.S. city of Toledo and Canada’s Pelee Island were warned that drinking tap-water piped from Lake Erie could endanger their lives. ^369 ^370 ‘Dead zones’ created by algae die-offs in Lake Winnipeg have at times covered half the lake’s surface, rivaling those in the Gulf of Mexico for expanse. ^367 Toxic blooms have even been spotted in the St. Lawrence River and the Salish Sea. ^366
 
#### Gender-bending new pollutants
 
After intestinal ailments killed seven people in Walkerton, ON, in 2000, and sickened half the population of North Battleford, SK, ten months later, many provinces tightened up regulations to protect Canadians’ drinking water. ^368 Traditional water-borne threats such as cholera and typhoid are largely vanquished, although hundreds of smaller and remote communities continue to experience water safety warnings, some of many years standing. ^368 ^371
 
Meanwhile exotic new contaminants have emerged to pose elusive but alarming threats to Canadians’ reproductive health. ^372 So-called ‘endocrine-disrupting chemicals’ (EDCs) are found in thousands of commercial products, from face creams to industrial cleaners. All mimic or disrupt natural hormone signals that normally control the body’s physical processes from growth to appetite. Low-level exposure at critical moments in life—notably conception and puberty—are being linked to a spate of strange effects on sex characteristics in both human and wildlife.
 
Doctors observe an ongoing decline in the number of Canadian boys being born in comparison to girls—equivalent to about 800 statistically ‘missing’ boys a year by 2010. ^373 ^368 Meanwhile hypospadias, a correctable birth defect in which the urethra opens at the base of the penis instead of the tip, is becoming more common. ^374 Reproductive system cancers—especially of the breast and testes—are also on the rise. ^372 Fish exposed to EDCs in wild settings display trans-gender physiology, fewer males, and in controlled experiments, eventually population collapse. ^375 Surveys have found scores of such EDCs in virtually every Canadian river, wetland and drinking-water reservoir tested from coast to coast. ^377 ^378
 
Of an estimated 23,000 such ‘chemicals of concern, Health Canada and Environment Canada have targeted 4,300 for re-evaluation, but do not expect to complete the task until 2020 at the earliest. ^368 Toxicity information for nearly nine in ten chemicals in current use (87%) is missing, the Council of Canadian Academies warned in 2012. ^379
 
#### Airborne wins and losses
 
Air quality presents the same mixed picture over the past two-and-a-half decades. While some pollutants, such as the nitrogen and sulfur oxides that created acid rain, have receded, others such as air-borne ammonia are on the rise. ^380 Toxic mercury, carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and EDCs have been found to be accumulating on surfaces downwind from Alberta’s oil sands regions. ^381 ^382
 
Global winds are blamed for carrying other pollutants from as far away as Asia to the Canadian arctic, where levels of exotic chemicals in the breast milk of nursing mothers in the North are on the rise. ^368 ^383 At the same time, smoke from massive fires in Canada’s boreal forest in 2013 and 2014 was tracked as far away as Europe. ^384 ^385
 
Canada has no equivalent of the Clean Water Act or Clean Air Act that set mandatory standards for water and air quality in the United States, nor of the Water Framework Directive, which does the same thing for Europe’s water. ^386 ^387 ^13 Instead, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), put into effect in 1989, allows the federal government to relinquish enforcement of water and air-quality goals to the provinces. ^112 ^309
 
This policy has failed repeated assessments over 25 years. In 1990, the federal Auditor General found “a serious deterioration in compliance” in every sector where Ottawa had delegated its monitoring and enforcement authority to the provinces. ^113 The most recent such federal-provincial agreement established national limits for some pollutants in municipal sewage effluent. However it postponed implementing those limits until 2020, for urgent cases, and as late as 2040 for all waste systems. ^162
 
By 2011, the Environment Commissioner found that Environment Canada had been enforcing fewer than half (19 of 45) of its own CEPA regulations. ^155 The department did not know whether it had been collecting reports that are legally required from six of nine “priority” polluting industries. And although it had added 68 enforcement positions since 2007, the number of inspections it actually conducted had dropped.
 
The tragic poster town for the undiminished risk Canadians face from toxic chemicals in their environment may be the small Anishinabek community of Aamjiwnaang, near Sarnia on the shore of the St. Clair River. ^388 The settlement of 850 is surrounded by Canada’s highest concentration of petro-chemical plants; their emissions suffuse its homes, school and playgrounds. By the first decade of the new millennium, the ‘normal’ human birth ratio of about 105 males to 100 females was so far out of balance in Aamjiwnaang that newborn girls outnumbered boys by two to one. Coaches filled three girls’ softball teams, but could only scrape together enough boys for one.
 
It was an unsettling indicator that Canadians are well justified in continuing to worry about what may be in the air and water.
