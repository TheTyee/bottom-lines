#### Canada’s greenhouse emissions briefly dropped, and are now forecast to rise sharply

Nothing has changed more widely or dramatically over the past 25 years than the global climate. And on no other subject has Canada’s  natural security policy reversed more sharply. In 1989, Canada was a leader in the international response to climate change. ^227 ^228 In many assessments it is now deemed a laggard. ^48 ^357
 
Over the same period, the evidence that human emissions of greenhouse gasses are the biggest factor in rising global temperatures has solidified. ^256 ^280 The human and economic costs of disrupting familiar climate patterns has become sharply clearer. ^258 ^292
 
The subject was well on Canadians’ radar a quarter century ago. Polled in 1989, almost 80 per cent responded that they were at least somewhat concerned about climate change. ^360 In subsequent surveys, the share of Canadians expressing concern for the climate has never dropped below 80 percent, and reached 88 per cent in 2013. ^361 ^362
 
That said, both Canadians’ acceptance of the scientific consensus that human activity is a leading factor in altering the climate, and their sense of how urgent it is to respond, have drifted downward in the past decade. Surveyed in 2007, 64.6 per cent of us agreed on a human role in climate change; 53.9 per cent thought it advisable to act sooner rather than later to contain its most dangerous implications. ^358 By 2013, agreement on a human contribution to climate change had slipped eight points to 56.4 per cent; support for early action had fallen below 45 per cent. ^419
 
#### Out front back in the day
 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was among the leaders of the world’s seven largest economies who called from their 1989 summit meeting in Paris for “common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide." ^227 The previous year, Canada had hosted an international meeting that proposed a global goal of reducing human CO2 emissions by 20 percent by 2005. Soon after the Paris summit, Canada joined 59 other countries in endorsing that objective. ^228
 
Canada was also an active participant in the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, where the ground was laid for the Kyoto accord on reducing greenhouse emissions, concluded five years later in 1997. ^231 Canada, by then under a Liberal government, promised to reduce its 676 million tons (MT) of greenhouse emissions that year to 555 MT by 2012. ^236
 
A global science assessment reported in 2001 that “demonstrable” change in global temperatures risked triggering “large-scale, high-impact, non-linear, and potentially abrupt changes” to Earth’s physical and biological systems. ^242 Heat stress, invasive pathogens, disrupted food supplies, storms and floods, were becoming more common.
 
Canada did not act to implement its Kyoto commitments until 2005 however. Eighteen days after the protocol came into international force that February, Prime Minister Paul Martin’s government committed $1 billion to purchase credits testifying to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world. ^248 It promised additional money for research and demonstration projects aimed at reducing industrial emissions. The measures were passed into law later that year, shortly before a general election ended the Liberal mandate.
 
Within months, the newly elected Conservative minority government announced that Canada would not meet its Kyoto emission targets. ^251 Nevertheless, it continued to assert that “this Government takes its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol very seriously.” And in early 2007 released a plan to reduce the “intensity” of industrial emissions (greenhouse gas releases per unit of output) by 18 per cent by 2010. The plan further envisaged a carbon price for industry of $65 a ton to take effect the same year, as well as an emissions trading system. ^254
 
In March of 2008, Natural Resources Canada reported that our climate was already changing, in ways that “will exacerbate many current climate risks, and present new risks,” as well as some opportunities. ^258 In particular, Canada is losing its winter ice—both in the Arctic and over the Great Lakes. Extreme weather threatens southern infrastructure, while “resource-dependent and Aboriginal communities are particularly vulnerable.” (A follow-up report in 2014 confirmed that all those trends continue. ^288)
 
Two months later, Prime Minister Stephen Harper asserted that Canada would, “in a relatively short period of time restrain and reverse the growth of GHG emissions.” ^260 Moreover, he said, “after 2012, oil sands operations will only be permitted if they can massively reduce their emissions.”
 
In the event, however, the government implemented none of the policies it had initially proposed. Instead, the government mandated specific emission reductions for various sectors of the economy. ^264 Matching a US initiative, in 2012 it required automakers to cut new car and light truck emissions in half by 2025. [278] It ordered new and refurbished coal-burning power plants to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. ^275 But speaking to Parliament as 2014 ended, the Prime Minister characterized as “crazy” calls for the implementation, assured six years earlier, of similar rules to limit Canada’s fastest-growing emissions source, the oil and gas industry.
 
Half of the ten southern provinces have in fact made headway in cutting their greenhouse emissions, but that accomplishment is more than offset by soaring emissions from Alberta and Saskatchewan (up 47 and 72 percent respectively between 1990 and 2012). ^421 Meanwhile Canada’s government has turned against two counter-measures it once endorsed: either a carbon tax like one pioneered in British Columbia, or an emissions cap with permit trading, as Quebec launched this year with California. ^422 ^253
 
Canada formally renounced its Kyoto commitments in 2011. ^273 Before doing so however it agreed (in Copenhagen in 2009) to a new target to be met by 2020: emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels, roughly 611 MT. ^265
 
Now that target too is beyond reach. Since dipping after the 2008 economic downturn, national emissions have hovered around 700 MT a year since 2010—roughly 14 per cent above our revised goal. ^421 In 2014 Canada reported to the United Nations that by 2020 our emissions are likely to breach 735 MT—20 per cent over its promise in by 2030. ^283
 
Canada’s serial failures to meet its climate commitments have attracted international censure. They have been identified as a factor in our plummeting standing on environmental care. ^48 ^53 In a 2014 assessment by Europe’s Climate Action Network of national responses to climate change, Morocco and Turkey warranted “good” grades; Canada, with Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia, were graded as “very poor.” ^357
 
The issue has created an intangible impediment to other national objectives, such as market access to Europe for Canadian crude oil and the proposed XL pipeline across America. ^425 ^426
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned again late last year that humanity must achieve “stringent” reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or face “irreversible and dangerous impacts.” ^280 World leaders will meet in Paris again this year, to consider new national reduction commitments.
 
#### Costs becoming clearer
 
Meanwhile, the cost of climate instability has come into sharper focus over 25 years. A report released with little fanfare by Natural Resources Canada early in 2014 warned that some livelihoods will no longer be “feasible and/or cost-effective” in the near future. ^288 Indeed, it appeared to endorse a fatalistic approach for some: selling “last chance tourism,” to witness wildlife and landscapes before they disappear.
 
Property damage from increasingly volatile weather has soared since 1989. 2013’s record-setting summer floods in Calgary and Toronto and year-end ice-storms typify the violent extremes being energized by additional heat in the global oceans and atmosphere. ^99 Hotter summers nurture more frequent poisonous algae blooms—raising health risks and water treatment costs. ^365 The B.C. and federal governments have spent over $1.2 billion so far to help communities adjust to the loss of forests devastated by insects no longer controlled by winter cold. ^427 Toronto’s Mowat Centre warns that the loss of water from the Great Lakes will cost its region $9.6 billion (and waterfront property owners directly $794 million) by 2030. ^106
 
Other studies have refined estimates of the risk that climate change presents to the global economy, as well as the benefits of limiting its advance. The World Bank calculated last year that tackling climate change would boost world gross economic product by $2.6 trillion (about three percent of its 2011 value) within 16 years. ^104 Shortly after, the International Monetary Fund reported that a national carbon tax modeled on British Columbia’s would boost growth in Canada by close to 0.8 per cent of GDP—about as much as the economy expanded in the first three months of 2014. ^297
 
After a quarter century of unmet commitments and climate policy neglect however, Canada finds itself ill-positioned to take advantage of such returns on initiative.
