#### Canada has made strong commitments on biodiversity; fewer promises have been fully met

In a Canada Day poll a couple of years ago, 83 per cent of us identified our untamed landscape as a “good” or “great” reflection of Canadian identity. ^389 And surely the iconic moose and orca, the loon that adorns the dollar and its twoonie counterpart the polar bear, the old national symbol of the beaver—all speak to Canadians’ affinity for the wildlife beyond our urban limits.

Our actual care for those iconic species and landscapes, let alone for lesser-known ones, reveals a quarter-century of unfulfilled good intentions however, and lengthening odds against the survival of many of our most emblematic fauna. 
 
Six major and several minor federal laws have been enacted to protect Canada’s ecosystems. In 1989, two were already nearly as old as the country: the Fisheries Act protected all fish and their habitat; the Navigable Waters Protection Act protected all of Canada’s rivers and lakes. ^391 ^392 Since 1930, the National Parks Act had allowed Ottawa to protect entire ecosystems. ^393
 
Three more laws of importance were added over the last quarter century. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, passed in 1988, came into effect in 1989; it consolidated federal powers to control air, water or ocean pollution. ^112 An Environmental Assessment Act, added in 1992, was intended to anticipate and prevent harm to ecosystems from human development. ^187 And in 2002 a Species at Risk Act promised to restore struggling wildlife populations. ^194 Other legislation provided for Marine Conservation Areas, the protection of migratory birds, controls on the use of pesticides, and penalties for offenses under all of these laws.
 
The collective scope of this legislation is impressive. But multiple assessments have concluded that it is failing across the board. ^35 ^46 ^48 Many of Canada’s most significant landscapes and species are more endangered now than at the start of the period we reviewed. ^214
 
There is some good news: seals and whales once hunted to near extinction are recovering in all of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans reported in 2010. ^205
 
### But a larger number of trends are negative.
 
According to the same assessment by federal scientists, all three oceans are becoming more acid, threatening the future of shellfish, and experiencing more exotic chemical contamination. Stifling ‘dead zones’ are appearing off our Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Toxic mercury is accumulating in the Arctic Ocean. On both the east and west coasts, commercial fish stocks have collapsed and the average size of the remaining fish has declined. Marine ‘trophic’ indices—which reflect the complexity of life present—have declined, indicating that simpler forms like worms and jelly fish are replacing higher ones like fin fish and marine mammals.
 
Numerous factors contribute to those changes. However Canada lags far behind other countries with long coastlines in the portion that is protected. More than 30 per cent of U.S. and Australian coastlines have protected status, and more than 11 per cent of Russia’s; less than two per cent of Canada’s coastline is similarly secure. ^395
 
In 2013, Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment advised Parliament that the federal government had not met its obligations under the Species At Risk Act. ^343 Of 97 recovery plans the law required, only seven were in place. Of those, three failed to identify habitat crucial to the species’ survival, while others provided no budget or failed to say what agency would take actions required to reverse the species’ decline. ^344
 
Federal reliance on the provinces to achieve national biodiversity goals has produced disappointing results. Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan have done the most to protect endangered species, but even in those provinces more than a quarter remain without statutory protection. ^396 In other provinces, as few as five percent of at-risk species are protected.
 
Meanwhile, many supposedly protected populations are dwindling. Migratory waterfowl (ducks and geese valued by hunters) have been well protected, but other shore, grassland and forest birds “are in major decline,” the Environment Commissioner reported. ^216 Disappearing fastest are “aerial insectivores that depend on flying insects for food.” British Columbia’s orcas, woodland and tundra caribou, and the Arctic bear that adorns Canada’s two-dollar piece are all among iconic megafauna that continue to face an uncertain future.
 
### Vanishing Canada
 
Entire landscapes are also disappearing, albeit mostly beyond urban notice. In the south-west Arctic, spruce forests are collapsing as the permafrost beneath them melts. ^398 A warmer, less stable climate is igniting more forest fires—that burn greater expanses of mature forest. ^397 Above the advancing northern treeline, satellites have observed lakes both forming and disappearing by the hundreds. ^399
 
Researchers speculate that British Columbia’s interior pine forests, devastated by a plague of bark beetles unleashed by warmer winters, will not return; rather, they will be replaced by prairie-like vegetation. ^401 Once-continuous boreal forest in Alberta and Saskatchewan is now so sliced by cut-lines cleared for seismic surveying that the balance of forces between caribou and their top predator, wolves, has shifted decisively in the wolves’ favour. ^207 ^402 Further east and south, rising temperatures are literally sucking the Great Lakes up into the air, increasing summer humidity and altering shorelines. ^106
 
How fast these changes are occurring, especially to species on the losing end of habitat loss, is difficult to know. Ottawa abandoned an initiative to provide Canadians with regular reports on the State of the Environment in 1993, amid government-wide budget cuts.
 
In the economic downdraft following the 2008 financial crisis, federal personnel engaged in environmental science were cut further. ^402 Several research facilities highly prized by researchers were scheduled for closure, although two—the Experimental Lakes Area in northwest Ontario and the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) on Ellesmere Island, Canada’s northernmost point—received reprieves, one by transfer to a non-government operator, the latter with a five-year funding extension. 
Ottawa also shifted the focus of federal support for science from government-sector research (typically focused on basic and natural-resource science) to technology development in the private and public-private university sectors. ^403
There have been some new science investments. Ground was broken in August for a new $142 million lab facility at Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, about 1,300 km south of the PEARL site; it’s expected to begin operating in 2017. ^354 ^404 And in August Ottawa announced $2.5 million (roughly one-tenth of what it budgets for prime ministerial security) for new climate research. ^293
Nonetheless numerous investigations by think-tanks, scientific bodies, individual authors and the federal Commissioner of the Environment—including several predating the present government—have drawn attention to the failure to collect reliable, consistent and long-term observations of such key indicators of natural security as water flows, air contamination, or wildlife populations. ^410 ^412
 
Environment Canada itself has acknowledged, in communications cited by the Environment Commissioner, that it has no idea whether nearly a third of Canada’s bird populations are safe from extinction. ^342 Its ability to ensure the health of entire ecosystems is no better: in 2013 the Commissioner reported that it had “made little progress in monitoring activities, conditions, and threats for the protected areas it manages.” ^343
 
These are not new lapses. In 2002 several groups lodged a complaint with the semi-judicial North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation that Canada, then under Liberal government, was not enforcing its laws protecting migratory birds. ^417 In 2007, the Commission upheld the complaint. ^197 ^418 The government, now under Conservative management, announced it was developing a new protection program but cancelled that initiative in 2010.
 
### Limiting Protection
 
The third modern legal leg of federal wildlife protection is the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, created by a Progressive Conservative government in 1992. ^187 Subsequent court decisions confirmed its country-wide force, and required its assessments to consider long-term as well as immediate impacts from development. ^132 ^310 

That Act was retired in 2012. A new Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (2012) requires far fewer reviews than the law it replaced—by one count, 3,000 fewer a year. ^337 Changes the same year to the 144-year-old Fisheries Act and the similarly venerable Navigable Waters Protection Act—renamed the Navigation Protection Act— sharply reduced their coverage from all fish species and most waterways in Canada, to a listed handful. ^336 ^159
 
In 2013, a global comparison of stewardship practices, led by Harvard economist Michael Porter, ranked Canada in 51st place among 132 countries in protecting its natural security—suggesting we care less for our iconic wildlife and landscapes than do either Bolivia or the Central African Republic. ^45
