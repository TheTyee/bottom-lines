            <p>The 2002 Pest Control Products Act requires the Minister of Health to review the safety of an approved chemical if an applicant can show significant new evidence of its potential danger. Lawyers acting on behalf of a B.C. woman took the Minister to Federal Court for refusing to review an ingredient in the popular herbicide Roundup.They cited several studies showing that polyoxyethylene tallow amines (POEA) harm human embryonic and placental cells, and are associated with an elevated risk of miscarriage among humans and animals exposed to the product. Once in court, the applicant’s lawyers concede that their evidence is insufficient to show a “health risk” to humans or animals, and withdraw their application for a review of the pesticide’s approval. The Court upholds their remaining application however, that the Minister should have ordered a special review of POEA’s risk to amphibians in seasonal wetlands exposed to aerial spraying. -- Josette Wier v Minister of Health 2011 (<a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/60153/1/document.do">Visit source</a>)<a href="#fnref:156" title="return to article"> ↩</a><p>

Despite an increase in the number of enforcement officers since 2003, the actual number of inspections, investigations, charges and convictions under the Canadian Environmental Protection and Fisheries Acts has fallen. Although officers issue around 2000 warnings and do 5000 inspections under the Fisheries Act per year, these result in an average of only 20 prosecutions. Low fines do not discourage industrial violators whose potential revenues and profits from their violations far exceed those fines.

            <p>The Species At Risk Act (SARA) commits Canada to implement plans for the recovery of species identified by a special committee of experts as being at high risk. In 2001 the committee identified one group of west coast orca whales as facing "imminent" extirpation or extinction, putting them in the highest risk category of “endangered.” It determined that another group was in the second-most-serious category, as a “threatened” species “likely to become… endangered… if nothing is done to reverse the factors leading to its extirpation or extinction.” Both groups of whales face similar threats, including environmental contamination, declining stocks of prey food, and physical and acoustic disturbances in their customary ranges. However, when the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans released a SARA plan to protect the whales’ critical habitat, it committed only to protect geophysical features such as shorelines and seabeds against damage by activities like pile-driving, sea-bed trawl fishing and ships’ anchors, arguing that other attributes are up to the minister's discretion to protect under other legislation. Nine environmental groups took the Crown to court. The Federal Court of Appeal agrees that SARA obliges the minister to protect all the habitat elements critical to the survival of threatened and endangered species—including factors such food prey—and that the Minister of Fisheries acted “unlawfully” in substituting discretionary action under other legislation for such a plan.

The new CEAA-2012 mandates environmental, social and economic impact assessments for far fewer projects than its predecessor, and gives political ministers much greater discretion to decide what impacts are reviewed and by whom. It limits the ability of environmental groups to participate in review hearings. The legislation also fully transfers responsibility for the environmental assessment of pipeline projects to the National Energy Board, and of nuclear projects to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (previously these were delegated from the Canadian Environment Assessment Agency on a case-by-case basis) and allows the federal cabinet to overrule any negative recommendation that either may make. Related amendments to the Fisheries Act now require environmental reviews only when a project may impact a fish species considered important for commercial, recreation or First Nations cultural purposes.

            <p>The Species At Risk Act (SARA) commits Canada to implement plans for the recovery of species at high risk. In 2001, the committee of experts responsible for identifying such species named one group of west coast orca whales as facing "imminent" extirpation or extinction, putting them in the highest risk category of “endangered.” It determined that another group was in the second-most-serious category, as a “threatened” species, “likely to become… endangered… if nothing is done to reverse the factors leading to its extirpation or extinction.” Both groups of whales face similar threats, including environmental contamination, declining stocks of prey food, and physical and acoustic disturbances in their customary ranges. However, when the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans released a SARA plan to protect the whales’ critical habitat, it committed only to protect geophysical features such as shorelines and seabeds against damage by activities like pile-driving, sea-bed trawl fishing and ships’ anchors, arguing that other attributes are up to the minister's discretion to protect under other legislation. Nine environmental groups took the Crown to court. The Federal Court of Appeal agrees that SARA obliges the minister to protect all the habitat elements critical to the survival of threatened and endangered species—including factors such food prey—and that the Minister of Fisheries acted “unlawfully” in substituting discretionary action under other legislation for such a plan.

Without regular monitoring, the Department cannot track whether the ecological integrity in protected areas is changing, nor can it identify any new or potential threats to local species so that it can react in an appropriate and timely manner.” (<a href="http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_cesd_201311_04_e_38674.html#hd3a">Visit source</a>)<a href="#fnref:218" title="return to article"> ↩</a><p>

            <p>The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development reports to Parliament that Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Parks Canada have failed to meet targets legally mandated in the Species At Risk Act (SARA) to establish recovery strategies for threatened species. Five years after a previous audit, they have made varying degrees of progress, but as of April 2013, 146 recovery strategies were incomplete and only seven of 97 required action plans were in place. Nearly half the mandated plans for species of special concern are incomplete. “Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Parks Canada have made notable progress,” on their share of the plans, the report says, but Environment Canada lags, with 84 per cent of its unfinished plans more than three years overdue. Of the strategies that have been completed nearly half fail to identify the at-risk species’ critical habitat.

            <p>Five environmental groups, including Greenpeace and the Sierra Club of B.C., took the federal Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and the Environment to court for their failure to meet deadlines prescribed in the Species At Risk Act (SARA) to develop recovery plans for four threatened or endangered populations of whales, sturgeon, murrelets and caribou. With the legally required plans more than three years overdue, Justice Anne Mactavish observes that, “The Ministers admit that they have failed to comply with their statutory obligations under SARA,” in a ruling that sharply criticizes the government for “egregious delays.” Although the court action had prompted the publication of draft recovery plans for three of the species at issue, and a final plan for the fourth, Justice MacTavish retained jurisdiction over the case to allow the plaintiffs to bring any further delays to her attention.

As a result the formula allows GHG ‘intensity’ to fall, while total emission rise.

Regulations currently in force for the 2011-2016 model years are estimated to reduce lifetime emissions from vehicles manufactured in that period by 92 Mt of CO2 equivalent. After the 2017 model year, car manufacturers must reduce their products' GHG emissions by an average of 5 per cent each model year until 2025.

However, “the gap between what we are achieving and what we need to do is growing wider every year," said a spokesman for Pricewaterhouse Coopers, which compiled the study. "Current pledges really put us on track for 3 degrees [of warming].” A more positive sign is that emerging economies including China, India and Mexico have reduced their economy’s carbon ‘intensity’ (how much carbon is emitted for every dollar of value produced) faster than the United States, Japan or the European Union.

Reviews of energy projects are reassigned from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to either the National Energy Board or the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission; both are centres of technical expertise in their respective sectors, but neither has previously been tasked to review projects in light of all of Canada’s federal statutes, as had the CEAA.

The agency is also operating in the dark, the Commissioner found: “Environment Canada has made little progress in monitoring activities, conditions, and threats for the protected areas it manages. The Department’s own assessments show a lack of proper inventories and insufficient information on species at risk. Monitoring of sites is done sporadically.
