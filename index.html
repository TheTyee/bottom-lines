                    <h3>Falling Grades</h3>
                    <h4>Twenty-five years of active lawmaking has not halted the decline of Canada’s ecosystems or environmental standing.</h4>
                    <p>Nothing says ‘Canada’ quite like a scenic vista—be it Gros Morne, the Saskatchewan sky, or a whale breeching in the Salish Sea. Canadians are justly proud of the vast variety of our landscapes. Our pride and concern for our natural environment has been rock-steady over a quarter of a century. Only Swiss and Norwegian citizens are more likely than Canadians to identify [355] the environment as their No. 1 political issue.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our leaders have appeared to be in step. Regardless of party, they have regularly assured us that Canada’s natural security is well protected. Legislation has been enacted [112,118,183,194] across an impressive range of fronts, from protecting species to penalizing polluters and preventing foreseeable harm.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet independent assessments [35,40,46,48,56],and a candid account of our history tell quite a different story. Much of this country’s original wealth was created by logging forests for timber, breaking native prairie for grain fields, and blasting minerals from hard rock. The idea that environmental loss is a regrettable but necessary price for prosperity has been deeply engrained. Last year, the Prime Minister argued against additional measures to preserve a stable climate by saying, “No country is going to take actions that are going to deliberately destroy jobs and growth in their country.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That this conventional wisdom is wrong is one of the clearest signals to emerge from the past quarter-century. To the contrary, a growing body of evidence [83,101,102,103,104,109] reveals the very large economic benefits that flow from healthy ecosystems, and the correspondingly high cost of their loss or disruption [86,93,99,105,108]. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Significantly, as the value of the security these natural systems provide has come more sharply into focus since the turn of the century, Canada’s standing on environmental stewardship has slipped from near the top of the class among developed countries, to near or even at the very bottom [14,48,198].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We examined the actions that Canada’s governments—of differing political stripes—have taken to protect and secure the environment since 1989, as well as the global context of those actions. Over the 25-year period to 2014, we found that state-of-the-art legislation to protect biodiversity, the safety of air and water, and critical natural systems, has never been fully implemented or effectively enforced. Numerous mandated goals remain unmet. [213,217,218]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The consequences of bi-partisan neglect are now becoming apparent. Many supposedly ‘protected’ species are at greater risk [214] today than they were in 1989. New and more elusive chemical threats have replaced older biological ones in Canada’s water—although some of the latter are also back with a vengeance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ambitious goals articulated a quarter-century ago [228] to reduce Canada’s climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions have slipped by unmet. [281] Our contributions to climate change [283] have reversed a brief decline and are now again trending upward, even as its manifestations take a growing toll [99] on livelihoods and structures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elsewhere, international investors and key agencies like the World Bank [104] and International Monetary Fund [110] now question the conventional Canadian wisdom that expanding the economy is worth any price to the environment. Bodies that report on how well different countries’ maintain their natural security have made the same link.</p>

                    <h3>From ‘A’s to ‘F’s</h3>
                    <p>
                        Such rankings are only as old as the new century. One of the earliest was completed in 2000 as a pilot project for the World Economic Forum. Combining 64 indicators, the Yale Centre for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science ranked Canada 7th [12] among 56 developed and developing countries. In a more polished version the following year, Canada scored even better: third in a field of 122. [14]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But more critical assessments surfaced almost at once. In the same year that Yale and Columbia placed Canada third in the world, researchers at the University of Victoria called Canada’s environmental record, “one of the poorest of the industrialized countries." [16] In follow-up comparisons, the same team ranked Canada 28th among 30 wealthy countries in 2005, [25] and 24th of 25 in 2010. [35]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other assessments have reached the same unflattering conclusion: against its developed peers, Canada trails. The United Nations Environment Program put us as low as 43rd in the world in environmental “vulnerability” in 2005. [26] The business-oriented Conference Board of Canada scored us 15th among 17 countries in 2013. [46]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That same year the Centre for Global Development put us last in class for environmental care: 27th in a field of 27 rich, educated nations. [48] And last year the Climate Action Network and a research partner again placed Canada at the very bottom of 58 countries whose climate protection policies they evaluated. [357]
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="clearfix">Not how we see ourselves</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our national decline in global stewardship rankings is at odds with Canadians’ priorities over the same years as captured in opinion polls, although these also reveal that we’ve long been skeptical that our governments were up to the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 1989, more than four-fifths of Canadians polled [360]by Environics Research agreed at least somewhat (and fully half felt so “strongly”) that pollution “threatens the very survival of the human race.” More than nine in ten of us were at least somewhat concerned about specific issues like acid rain, toxic chemicals, and air and water quality. Concern for wildlife followed closely. Climate change was on the minds of eight Canadians in ten even then. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, Canadians were roughly split on whether the federal government was doing a “fair” job protecting the environment, or a “poor” one. Four in ten nonetheless optimistically believed the environment would improve over the following decade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A dozen years later, further research by the same company revealed that public concern about threats like toxic chemicals, water quality and wildlife, had hardly changed. [361] Confidence in the federal government was up modestly: by 2001 more than half of Canadians felt it was doing a “fair” job; only 29% rated it “poor.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The financial crisis that struck in 2008 dramatically changed Canadians’ priorities. The year before, polls had placed the environment in a statistical tie with health care as the country’s most important problem in citizens’ eyes. [358] By the following year, it had dropped to a distant third, buried by worry over the economy. [359]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There has been a corresponding drop-off in pollsters’ interest in Canadians’ environmental views since then, but a handful of studies confirm that our concern hasn’t lessened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Environics found in 2013 that more Canadians identified the economy than the environment as the country’s #1 issue just then. [362] But when they considered the future, they saw the loss of our natural security as the greatest threat. Other research found that while Canadians’ have become more certain that human activity is causing climate change, their confidence in government to be the “lead actor” in response, has dropped.
                    </p>
                    <p>In short: Canadians’ concern for the environment has changed little over 25 years. Governments claim to have taken effective action. Yet our grades are dropping. Below, we explore this paradox in detail.</p>

                    <p>When Canadians were asked back in 1989 to name their biggest environmental concerns, the top three answers they gave were, in descending order: toxic chemicals, water quality, and air quality. [360] Four in ten were hopeful that things would improve within a decade.</p>

                    <p>Two and a half decades later, toxic chemicals, water and air quality are still among Canadians’ top concerns. [362] But whether those 1989-era hopes have been realized depends on where you look. Some former threats have receded, but others have taken their place. And a few banes that once appeared to be conquered are now back and more dangerous than ever.</p>

                    <p>An example is blue-green algae—a type of primitive phyto-plankton.  These can be dangerous as well as unsightly: when blue-green algae die and break down they release potent neuro and hepato-toxins, [363] destructive to nerve and liver systems respectively. Contact can produce headaches, fever, abdominal pain, nausea and death.</p> 

                    <p>The primary cause of their summertime ‘blooms’ in lakes, oceans and rivers is an over-abundance of dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen—ingredients in farm and garden fertilizers that have the same powerful effect in the wild, ‘fertilizing’ the rapid growth of aquatic algae. The organisms flourish particularly well in water bodies depleted and warmed by a changing climate.</p> 

                    <p>And such toxic blooms are spreading. [364, 365] Once banished from Lake Erie, blooms have returned to the shallowest Great Lake. Last summer, residents of the U.S. city of Toledo and Canada’s Pelee Island were warned that drinking tap-water piped from Lake Erie could endanger their lives. [369, 370] ‘Dead zones’ created by algae die-offs in Lake Winnipeg have at times covered half the lake’s surface, rivaling those in the Gulf of Mexico for expanse. [367] Toxic blooms have even been spotted in the St. Lawrence River and the Salish Sea. [366]</p>

                    <h5 class="clearfix">Gender-bending new pollutants</h5>

                    <p>After intestinal ailments killed seven people in Walkerton, ON, in 2000, and sickened half the population of North Battleford, SK, ten months later, many provinces tightened up regulations to protect Canadians’ drinking water. [368] Traditional water-borne threats such as cholera and typhoid are largely vanquished, although hundreds of smaller and remote communities continue to experience water safety warnings, some of many years standing. [368, 371]</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile exotic new contaminants have emerged to pose elusive but alarming threats to Canadians’ reproductive health. [372] So-called ‘endocrine-disrupting chemicals’ (EDCs) are found in thousands of commercial products, from face creams to industrial cleaners. All mimic or disrupt natural hormone signals that normally control the body’s physical processes from growth to appetite. Low-level exposure at critical moments in life—notably conception and puberty—are being linked to a spate of strange effects on sex characteristics in both human and wild life.</p>

                    <p>
                        Doctors observe an ongoing decline in the number of Canadian boys being born in comparison to girls—equivalent to about 800 statistically ‘missing’ boys a year by 2010. [373, 368] Meanwhile hypospadias, a correctable birth defect in which the urethra opens at the base of the penis instead of the tip, is becoming more common. [374] Reproductive system cancers—especially of the breast and testes—are also on the rise. [372] Fish exposed to EDCs in wild settings display trans-gender physiology, fewer males, and in controlled experiments, eventually population collapse. [375] Surveys have found scores of such EDCs in virtually every Canadian river, wetland and drinking-water reservoir tested from coast to coast. [376,377,378]
                    </p>

                    <p>Of an estimated 23,000 such ‘chemicals of concern, Health Canada and Environment Canada have targeted 4,300 for re-evaluation, but do not expect to complete the task until 2020 at the earliest. [368] Toxicity information for nearly nine in ten chemicals in current use (87%) is missing, the Council of Canadian Academies warned in 2012. [379]</p>

                        <p>Air quality presents the same mixed picture over the past two-and-a-half decades. While some pollutants, such as the nitrogen and sulfur oxides that created acid rain, have receded, others such as air-borne ammonia are on the rise. [380] Toxic mercury, carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and EDCs have been found to be accumulating on surfaces downwind from Alberta’s oil sands regions. [368, 381, 382]</p>

                        <p>Global winds are blamed for carrying other pollutants from as far away as Asia to the Canadian arctic, where levels of exotic chemicals in the breast milk of nursing mothers in the North are on the rise. [368, 383] At the same time, smoke from massive fires in Canada’s boreal forest in 2013 and 2014 was tracked as far away as Europe. [384, 385]</p> 

                        <p>Canada has no equivalent of the Clean Water Act [386] or Clean Air Act that set mandatory standards for water and air quality in the United States, nor of the Water Framework Directive, which does the same thing for Europe’s water. [368, 28] Instead, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), put into effect in 1989, allows the federal government to relinquish enforcement of water and air-quality goals to the provinces. [112, 134, 309]</p>

                        <p>This policy has failed repeated assessments over 25 years. In 1990, the federal Auditor General found “a serious deterioration in compliance” in every sector where Ottawa had delegated its monitoring and enforcement authority to the provinces. [113] The most recent such federal-provincial agreement established national limits for some pollutants in municipal sewage effluent. However it postponed implementing those limits until 2020, for urgent cases, and as late as 2040 for all waste systems. [162]</p> 

                        <p>By 2011, the Environment Commissioner found that Environment Canada had been enforcing fewer than half (19 of 45) of its own CEPA regulations. [155] The department did not know whether it had been collecting reports that are legally required from six of nine “priority” polluting industries. And although it had added 68 enforcement positions since 2007, the number of inspections it actually conducted had dropped.</p>

                        <p>The tragic poster town for the undiminished risk Canadians face from toxic chemicals in their environment may be the small Anishinabek community of Aamjiwnaang, near Sarnia on the shore of the St. Clair River. [388] The settlement of 850 is surrounded by Canada’s highest concentration of petro-chemical plants; their emissions suffuse its homes, school and playgrounds. By the first decade of the new millennium, the ‘normal’ human birth ratio of about 105 males to 100 females was so far out of balance in Aamjiwnaang that newborn girls outnumbered boys by two to one. Coaches filled three girls’ softball teams, but could only scrape together enough boys for one.</p> 

                        <p>It was an unsettling indicator that Canadians are well justified in continuing to worry about what may be in the air and water.</p>

                        <p>In a Canada Day poll a couple of years ago, 83 per cent of us identified our untamed landscape as a “good” or “great” reflection of Canadian identity. [389] And surely the iconic moose and orca, the loon that adorns the dollar and its twoonie counterpart the polar bear, the old national symbol of the beaver—all speak to Canadians’ affinity for the wildlife beyond our urban limits.</p> 

                        <p>Our actual care for those iconic species and landscapes, let alone for lesser-known ones, reveals a quarter-century of unfulfilled good intentions however, and lengthening odds against the survival of many of our most emblematic fauna. [219, 224, 390]</p>

                        <p>Six major and several minor federal laws have been enacted to protect Canada’s ecosystems. In 1989, two were already nearly as old as the country: the Fisheries Act protected all fish and their habitat [391]; the Navigable Waters Protection Act protected all of Canada’s rivers and lakes. [392] Since 1930, the National Parks Act had allowed Ottawa to protect entire ecosystems. [393]</p>

                        <p>Three more laws of importance were added over the last quarter century. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, passed in 1988, came into effect in 1989; it consolidated federal powers to control air, water or ocean pollution. [112] An Environmental Assessment Act, added in 1992, was intended to anticipate and prevent harm to ecosystems from human development. [118, 183, 187] And in 2002 a Species at Risk Act promised to restore struggling wildlife populations. [194] Other legislation provided for Marine Conservation Areas, the protection of migratory birds, controls on the use of pesticides, and penalties for offenses under all of these laws.</p>

                        <p>The collective scope of this legislation is impressive. But multiple assessments have concluded that it is failing across the board. [35, 46, 48] Many of Canada’s most significant landscapes and species are more endangered now than at the start of the period we reviewed. [214]</p>

                        <p>There is some good news: seals and whales once hunted to near extinction are recovering in all of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans reported in 2010. [205]</p> 

                        <h5 class="clearfix">But a larger number of trends are negative.</h5>

                        <p>According to the same assessment by federal scientists, all three oceans are becoming more acid, threatening the future of shellfish, and experiencing more exotic chemical contamination. Stifling ‘dead zones’ are appearing off our Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Toxic mercury is accumulating in the Arctic Ocean. On both the east and west coasts, commercial fish stocks have collapsed and the average size of the remaining fish has declined. Marine ‘trophic’ indices—which reflect the complexity of life present—have declined, indicating that simpler forms like worms and jelly fish are replacing higher ones like fin fish and marine mammals.</p>

                        <p>Numerous factors contribute to those changes. However Canada lags far behind other countries with long coastlines in the portion that is protected. More than 30 per cent of U.S. and Australian coastlines have protected status, and more than 11 per cent of Russia’s; less than two per cent of Canada’s coastline is similarly secure. [395]</p>

                        <p>In 2013, Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment advised Parliament that the federal government had not met its obligations under the Species At Risk Act. [343] Of 97 recovery plans the law required, only seven were in place. Of those, three failed to identify habitat crucial to the species’ survival, while others provided no budget or failed to say what agency would take actions required to reverse the species’ decline. [344]</p>

                        <p>Federal reliance on the provinces to achieve national biodiversity goals has produced disappointing results. Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan have done the most to protect endangered species, but even in those provinces more than a quarter remain without statutory protection. [396] In other provinces, as few as five percent of at-risk species are protected.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, many supposedly protected populations are dwindling. Migratory waterfowl (ducks and geese valued by hunters) have been well protected, but other shore, grassland and forest birds “are in major decline,” the Environment Commissioner reported. [216] Disappearing fastest are “aerial insectivores that depend on flying insects for food.” British Columbia’s orcas, woodland and tundra caribou, and the Arctic bear that adorns Canada’s two-dollar piece are all among iconic megafauna that continue to face an uncertain future.</p>

                        <h5 class="clearfix">Vanishing Canada</h5>

                        <p>Entire landscapes are also disappearing, albeit mostly beyond urban notice. In the south-west Arctic, spruce forests are collapsing as the permafrost beneath them melts. [398] A warmer, less stable climate is igniting more forest fires—that burn greater expanses of mature forest. [397] Above the advancing northern treeline, satellites have observed lakes both forming and disappearing by the hundreds. [399]</p>

                        <p>Researchers speculate that British Columbia’s interior pine forests, devastated by a plague of bark beetles unleashed by warmer winters, will not return; rather, they will be replaced by prairie-like vegetation. [401] Once-continuous boreal forest in Alberta and Saskatchewan is now so sliced by cut-lines cleared for seismic surveying that the balance of forces between caribou and their top predator, wolves, has shifted decisively in the wolves’ favour. [207, 402] Further east and south, rising temperatures are literally sucking the Great Lakes up into the air, increasing summer humidity and altering shorelines. [106]</p>

                        <p>How fast these changes are occurring, especially to species on the losing end of habitat loss, is difficult to know. Ottawa abandoned an initiative to provide Canadians with regular reports on the State of the Environment in 1993, amid government-wide budget cuts.</p> 

                        <p>In the economic downdraft following the 2008 financial crisis, federal personnel engaged in environmental science were cut further. [402] Several research facilities highly prized by researchers were scheduled for closure, although two—the Experimental Lakes Area in northwest Ontario and the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) on Ellesmere Island, Canada’s northernmost point—received reprieves, one by transfer to a non-government operator, [335,349] the latter with a five-year funding extension. [333,339]</p>

                        <p>Ottawa also shifted the focus of federal support for science from government-sector research (typically focused on basic and natural-resource science) to technology development in the private and public-private university sectors. [403]</p>

                        <p>There have been some new science investments. Ground was broken in August for a new $142 million lab facility at Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, about 1,300 km south of the PEARL site; it’s expected to begin operating in 2017. [354, 404] And in August Ottawa announced $2.5 million (roughly one-tenth of what it budgets for prime ministerial security) for new climate research. [293]</p>

                        <p>Nonetheless numerous investigations by think-tanks, scientific bodies, individual authors and the federal Commissioner of the Environment—including several predating the present government—have drawn attention to the failure to collect reliable, consistent and long-term observations of such key indicators of natural security as water flows, air contamination, or wildlife populations. [405-416]</p>

                        <p>Environment Canada itself has acknowledged, in communications cited by the Environment Commissioner, that it has no idea whether nearly a third of Canada’s bird populations are safe from extinction. [342] Its ability to ensure the health of entire ecosystems is no better: in 2013 the Commissioner reported that it had “made little progress in monitoring activities, conditions, and threats for the protected areas it manages.” [343]</p>

                        <p>These are not new lapses. In 2002 several groups lodged a complaint with the semi-judicial North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation that Canada, then under Liberal government, was not enforcing its laws protecting migratory birds. [417] In 2007, the Commission upheld the complaint. [197,418] The government, now under Conservative management, announced it was developing a new protection program but cancelled that initiative in 2010.</p>

                        <h5 class="clearfix">Limiting Protection</h5>

                        <p>The third modern legal leg of federal wildlife protection is the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, created by a Progressive Conservative government in 1992. [187] Subsequent court decisions confirmed its country-wide force, and required its assessments to consider long-term as well as immediate impacts from development. [301,310,311,315]</p>

                        <p>That Act was retired in 2012. A new Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (2012) requires far fewer reviews than the law it replaced—by one count, 3,000 fewer a year. [337] Changes the same year to the 144-year-old Fisheries Act and the similarly venerable Navigable Waters Protection Act—renamed the Navigation Protection Act— sharply reduced their coverage from all fish species and most waterways in Canada, to a listed handful. [336,159]</p>

                        <p>In 2013, a global comparison of stewardship practices, led by Harvard economist Michael Porter, ranked Canada in 51st place among 132 countries in protecting its natural security—suggesting we care less for our iconic wildlife and landscapes than do either Bolivia or the Central African Republic.

And on no other subject has Canada’s  natural security policy reversed more sharply. In 1989, Canada was a leader in the international response to climate change. [227,228] In many assessments it is now deemed a laggard. [48,285,357]</p>

                            <p>Over the same period, the evidence that human emissions of greenhouse gasses are the biggest factor in rising global temperatures has solidified. [229,233,242,256,280] The human and economic costs of disrupting familiarsclimate patterns has become sharply clearer. [111,288,291,298]</p>

                            <p>The subject was well on Canadians’ radar a quarter century ago. Polled in 1989, almost 80 per cent responded that they were at least somewhat concerned about climate change.[360] In subsequent surveys, the share of Canadians expressing concern for the climate has never dropped below 80 percent, and reached 88 per cent in 2013. [358,359,361]</p>

                            <p>That said, both Canadians’ acceptance of the scientific consensus that human activity is a leading factor in altering the climate, and their sense of how urgent it is to respond, have drifted downward in the past decade. Surveyed in 2007, 64.6 per cent of us agreed on a human role in climate change; 53.9 per cent thought it advisable to act sooner rather than later to contain its most dangerous implications. [358] By 2013, agreement on a human contribution to climate change had slipped eight points to 56.4 per cent; support for early action had fallen below 45 per cent. [419]</p>

                            <h5 class="clearfix">Out front back in the day</h5>

                            <p>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was among the leaders of the world’s seven largest economies who called from their 1989 summit meeting in Paris for “common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide." [227 The previous year, Canada had hosted an international meeting that proposed a global goal of reducing human CO2 emissions by 20 percent by 2005. Soon after the Paris summit, Canada joined 59 other countries in endorsing that objective. [228]</p>

                            <p>Canada was also an active participant in the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, where the ground was laid for the Kyoto accord on reducing greenhouse emissions, concluded five years later in 1997. [231] Canada, by then under a Liberal government, promised to reduce its 676 million tons (MT) of greenhouse emissions that year to 555 MT by 2012. [236]</p>

                            <p>A global science assessment reported in 2001 that “demonstrable” change in global temperatures risked triggering “large-scale, high-impact, non-linear, and potentially abrupt changes” to Earth’s physical and biological systems. [242] Heat stress, invasive pathogens, disrupted food supplies, storms and floods, were becoming more common.</p> 

                            <p>Canada did not act to implement its Kyoto commitments until 2005 however. Eighteen days after the protocol came into international force that February, Prime Minister Paul Martin’s government committed $1 billion to purchase credits testifying to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world. [248] It promised additional money for research and demonstration projects aimed at reducing industrial emissions. The measures were passed into law later that year, shortly before a general election ended the Liberal mandate.</p>

                            <p>Within months, the newly elected Conservative minority government announced that Canada would not meet its Kyoto emission targets. [251] Nevertheless, it continued to assert that “this Government takes its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol very seriously.” And in early 2007 released a plan to reduce the “intensity” of industrial emissions (greenhouse gas releases per unit of output) by 18 per cent by 2010. The plan further envisaged a carbon price for industry of $65 a ton to take effect the same year, as well as an emissions trading system. [254]</p>

                            <p>In March of 2008, Natural Resources Canada reported that our climate was already changing, in ways that “will exacerbate many current climate risks, and present new risks,” as well as some opportunities. [258] In particular, Canada is losing its winter ice—both in the Arctic and over the Great Lakes. Extreme weather threatens southern infrastructure, while “resource-dependent and Aboriginal communities are particularly vulnerable.” (A follow-up report in 2014 confirmed that all those trends continue. [288])</p> 

                            <p>Two months later, Prime Minister Stephen Harper asserted that Canada would, “in a relatively short period of time restrain and reverse the growth of GHG emissions.” [260] Moreover, he said, “after 2012, oil sands operations will only be permitted if they can massively reduce their emissions.”</p> 

                            <p>In the event, however, the government implemented none of the policies it had initially proposed. Instead, the government mandated specific emission reductions for various sectors of the economy. [264] Matching a US initiative, in 2012 it required automakers to cut new car and light truck emissions in half by 2025. [278] It ordered new and refurbished coal-burning power plants to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. [275] But speaking to Parliament as 2014 ended, the Prime Minister characterized as “crazy” calls for the implementation, assured six years earlier, of similar rules to limit Canada’s fastest-growing emissions source, the oil and gas industry.</p>

                            <p>Half of the ten southern provinces have in fact made headway in cutting their greenhouse emissions, but that accomplishment is more than offset by soaring emissions from Alberta and Saskatchewan (up 47 and 72 percent respectively between 1990 and 2012). [421] Meanwhile Canada’s government has turned against two counter-measures it once endorsed: either a carbon tax like one pioneered in British Columbia, or an emissions cap with permit trading, as Quebec launched this year with California. [422,423,253,424]</p>

                            <p>Canada formally renounced its Kyoto commitments in 2011. [273] Before doing so however it agreed (in Copenhagen in 2009) to a new target to be met by 2020: emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels, roughly 611 MT. [265]</p>

                            <p>Now that target too is beyond reach. Since dipping after the 2008 economic downturn, national emissions have hovered around 700 MT a year since 2010—roughly 14 per cent above our revised goal. [421] In 2014 Canada reported to the United Nations that by 2020 our emissions are likely to breach 735 MT—20 per cent over its promise in by 2030. [283]</p>

                            <p>Canada’s serial failures to meet its climate commitments have attracted international censure. They have been identified as a factor in our plummeting standing on environmental care. [48,53] In a 2014 assessment by Europe’s Climate Action Network of national responses to climate change, Morocco and Turkey warranted “good” grades; Canada, with Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia, were graded as “very poor.” [357]</p>

                            <p>The issue has created an intangible impediment to other national objectives, such as market access to Europe for Canadian crude oil and the proposed XL pipeline across America. [425,426]</p>

                            <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned again late last year that humanity must achieve “stringent” reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or face “irreversible and dangerous impacts.” [280] World leaders will meet in Paris again this year, to consider new national reduction commitments.</p>

                            <h5 class="clearfix">Costs becoming clearer</h5>

                            <p>Meanwhile, the cost of climate instability has come into sharper focus over 25 years. A report released with little fanfare by Natural Resources Canada early in 2014 warned that some livelihoods will no longer be “feasible and/or cost-effective” in the near future. [288] Indeed, it appeared to endorse a fatalistic approach for some: selling “last chance tourism,” to witness wildlife and landscapes before they disappear.</p>

                            <p>Property damage from increasingly volatile weather has soared since 1989. 2013’s record-setting summer floods in Calgary and Toronto and year-end ice-storms typify the violent extremes being energized by additional heat in the global oceans and atmosphere. [99] Hotter summers nurture more frequent poisonous algae blooms—raising health risks and water treatment costs. [365] The B.C. and federal governments have spent over $1.2 billion so far to help communities adjust to the loss of forests devastated by insects no longer controlled by winter cold. [427] Toronto’s Mowat Centre warns that the loss of water from the Great Lakes will cost its region $9.6 billion (and waterfront property owners directly $794 million) by 2030. [106]</p>

                            <p>Other studies have refined estimates of the risk that climate change presents to the global economy, as well as the benefits of limiting its advance. The World Bank calculated last year that tackling climate change would boost world gross economic product by $2.6 trillion (about three percent of its 2011 value) within 16 years. [104] Shortly after, the International Monetary Fund reported that a national carbon tax modeled on British Columbia’s would boost growth in Canada by close to 0.8 per cent of GDP—about as much as the economy expanded in the first three months of 2014. [297]</p>

                            <p>After a quarter century of unmet commitments and climate policy neglect however, Canada finds itself ill-positioned to take advantage of such returns on initiative.</p>

                                <p>It’s an old economic truism, a corollary of the law of supply and demand, that scarcity creates value. In an era when natural capital is disappearing, it is also increasingly highly valued. Canada’s ineffective stewardship of its ecological assets puts at risk hundreds of billions, potentially trillions, of dollars worth of wealth, in addition to intrinsic and cultural values.</p>

                                <p>Economists have estimated that the ecological services provided by the Mackenzie River watershed in northern Canada are worth some $571 billion a year—thirteen and a half times the region’s official GDP of $42 billion. [83] In 2014 an unknown portion of that wealth went up in smoke, when fires consumed vast swaths of boreal forest. Soot from the fires in the Northwest Territories drifted downwind to darken Greenland’s ice sheets, hastening their melt. [384]</p>

                                <p>The anecdote illustrates how perceptions of environmental stewardship and risk have tightened over a quarter-century. Canadians feared for their natural security as long ago as 1989, when eight in ten of us agreed at least somewhat in surveys (and half of us, “strongly”), that pollution “threatens the survival of the human race.” [360]</p>

                                <p>The nature and extent of that threat, and how much we stand to lose, are now much clearer.</p> 

                                <p>The eco-systems that provide Canadians with their natural security, that sustain health and prosperity, are weakening and degrading. While some old hazards are in check, others have resurfaced and new ones are appearing in our air and water. [372] Wildlife and landscapes deeply woven into Canadians’ identity are at more risk now than 25 years ago. [366,394] And a quarter-century after Canada’s government endorsed cutting our annual greenhouse gas emissions to 472 MT within sixteen years, they are nearly one and a half times that, and will rise more by 2020 and beyond. [283]</p>

                                <p>If Canada has realized few of the good intentions embodied in its array of environmental legislation, research and experience have heightened our awareness of what’s at stake. Setting aside—though not discounting—the intangible cultural and spiritual values received from natural landscapes, the release of tension found in an urban park or remote campsite, and the moral “existence value” imputed to non-human creatures, close analysis has revealed with growing precision the measurable benefits that natural infrastructure provides to our dollar-denominated economy.</p> 

                                <p>An early study, for example, estimated in 1996 that British Columbia received $2.75 billion a year (adjusted for inflation to 2014) in non-lumber value from its pre-pine-beetled forests, mainly from outdoor recreation, but also from wildlife viewing and recreational fishing and hunting. [59]</p>

                                <p>Investigators have since revealed the economic value of services that Ontarians derive from Toronto’s greenbelt: farmland, recreational areas, water collection and air quality benefits ring in at $2.7 billion a year. [77] Toronto’s trees were revealed in a different study to be worth more than $80 million annually, in services that run from energy-saving shade to scrubbing pollutants from the air; that amount was more than the city spent in 2014 on economic development and recreation. The asset value of the urban forest was assessed at $7 billion. [103]</p>

                                <p>The value of climate-threatening carbon stored in Manitoba’s 50 million hectares of boreal forest was assessed in 2014 at $117 billion—10 times the province’s full budget—not counting recreation, hunting, and other economic contributions. [101]</p>

                                <p>Our peers and trading partners are moving beyond the outdated perspective that economic and natural security present a zero-sum dilemma, in which preserving the environment can only reduce prosperity. Policies increasingly recognize that the two are additive: that resilient, productive ecosystems also expand national and corporate bottom lines.</p> 

                                <p>Some of these suggest practical steps for Canadians to consider, in order to reverse the erosion of our environmental advantage.</p>

                                <h5 class="clearfix">Standards and accountability</h5>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>It may be axiomatic that it’s impossible to manage what you don’t measure. Yet a recurrent complaint among experts is that Canada lacks the consistent and timely reporting of critical ecological variables, from snow depth to species populations, needed to support sound decisions. In the words of a joint federal-provincial study in 2010: "Information critical to the assessment of ecosystem health is missing." [405-416]</p>
                                        <p>Nearly 50 European governments have countered their own impulse to overlook environmental decay by joining the Aarhus Convention. It commits them to gather and publish enough information about their national environment to establish its status. Anyone who believes a government is failing to do so, may request an arms-length investigation and ask national courts to compel compliance with any judgment that results. [10]</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Near-term electoral rewards may tempt any democratic government to overlook long-term environmental losses in its decisions. Britain, India, Australia and the United States all broadly share Canada’s legal tradition, but have found at least a partial answer in a legal doctrine known as the “Public Trust.” [428]</p>
                                        <p>Derived from Roman antecedents, it holds that governments have an inescapable duty to current and future citizens to protect certain natural features, especially related to water—and that citizens may ask the courts to force governments to meet that responsibility. Written into constitutions and simple legislation, the doctrine has obliged governments at all levels to improve their stewardship.</p> 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Canadians remain as concerned for the security of their air and water today as they were in 1989. Justifiably: new biological and synthetic toxic threats have emerged, and Canada continues to lack mandatory national air or water pollution limits.</p>
                                        <p>The United States has had mandatory standards for air and water quality for over 40 years. Contained in the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, they are enforced on a county-by-county basis. [386,387] Rules adopted in the European Union in 2007 require importers and manufacturers to replace the most toxic industrial compounds with more benign alternatives; the changes are expected to save the EU $4 billion a year in health costs. [28]</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Other countries and some provinces have pioneered other effective approaches to better environmental stewardship: regulated water ‘markets’ (Australia and Alberta); watershed-based stewardship (France and, for more than seven decades, Ontario); taxes on carbon emissions (Britain, British Columbia) [429]; special courts that can order companies to compensate communities for lost eco-services (Mexico) [430]; and legal rights to a clean environment (Mexico and more than 110 other countries). [431]</p>

                                <p>There has been another transformative advance in the quarter century since 1989: plummeting technology costs now make it affordable for environmental managers to stay on top of complex and variable natural conditions in real-time. Examples can be found in southwestern Alberta and British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley where mounting water scarcity has prompted the development of highly sophisticated tracking systems that could prove models for the rest of the country. [432]</p>

                                <p>Only the Norse and the Swiss are more likely than Canadians to rank the environment as their country’s most important issue. [355] The same world study that revealed that curious factoid however, also scored Canadians’ actual behavior as “green” consumers in 16th place among the 17 countries it examined—marginally above dead last.</p>

                                <p>The shortfall between the environmental aspirations we express as Canadians, and Canada’s achievements over the past quarter-century, is irrefutable. But it’s not inevitable. Effective models for action surround us. And the same 25-year perspective reveals that we have a fast-rising economic, as well as ecological, stake in the outcome.</p>

                            Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2004, but their decline since then has stalled. levels in 2012 were 40% above canada’s target for that year under the 1997 kyoto protocol, [link tk] (targets that were abandoned [link tk] in 2011), and 14% above the new target for the year 2020 that canada adopted in copenhagen [link tk] in 2009.

                                    <h3>About The Project</h3>

<p>
    The Tyee Solutions Society is a Canadian non-profit association supported by philanthropic funding that uses traditional investigative techniques and innovative technological approaches to provide citizens with the information they need to create positive change. Its previous work has included new approaches to aboriginal education and practical ideas for ‘greening’ Canada’s oil sands.
</p> 

<p>This series was produced by the Tyee Solutions Society (TSS) in collaboration with Tides Canada Initiatives, with funding from the Gencon Foundation. Tides Canada Initiatives and the Gencon Foundation neither influence nor endorse the particular content of TSS' reporting and guarantee its full editorial autonomy.

<p>This TSS assignment asked a deceptively simple question: Cutting through all partisan rhetoric, how well has Canada cared for its environment, really?</p> 

<p>The result is a ‘just the facts ma’am’ record of the best answers we could find. To make our report the most objective one possible without conducting prohibitively expensive original science, we spent 10 months combing the most reliable publically available sources: government documents, scientific papers, reports from independent international bodies, leading research and think-tank organizations. To help overcome a potential bias toward only the most recent activities, we examined a full quarter-century of Canada’s environmental record—a period during which five Prime Ministers from three parties occupied 24 Sussex Drive.</p> 

<p>This method had some weaknesses. Some older and formerly public government reports have become difficult to obtain as a result of changes to archiving policy. Continuous records of key environmental variables are in any case few (as many of the reports we reviewed also observed). Some information simply did not exist in 1989. Evidence-based ranking of countries’ environmental stewardship dates only to 2000. In other cases time liberated information that might once have been locked behind proprietary walls—such as detailed polling results.</p>

<p>The search produced hundreds of individual records, across six environmental dimensions, covering the entire period chronologically. These records, with links to their sources, can be found here; we hope other researchers find them of use. We have made every effort to confirm the accuracy of each of these, but do not guarantee it all cases. For some earlier events, dates are best approximations. We will be grateful to have errors brought to our attention.</p> 

<p>We are also grateful to the Environmental Law Centre at the University of Victoria for its assistance in identifying and providing analysis of key legislative and judicial developments since 1989, and to Evidence for Democracy for data relating to government support for science.</p>

<p>Chris Wood was the primary researcher on this project and wrote the main text. David Beers supervised the research and edited the text. Phillip Smith created the underlying website technology. Alex Grunenfelder styled the many infographics. Carra Simpson administered the project.</p> 

<p>This report is novel not only in its examination of a full quarter-century of federal stewardship of the world’s second-largest land mass, but in being tailored from inception to reach Canadians in every way that they seek out knowledge in the 21st century. We hope it becomes a place where Canadians using any device can go to answer for themselves how well their country has cared for any aspect of the environment that concerns them.</p> 
<p>We ourselves draw no broader conclusion than this to the general question we were asked: “How well has Canada cared for its environment, really?” Sadly, not very well.</p>
