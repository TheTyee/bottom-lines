                    <h3>Falling Grades</h3>
                    <h4>Twenty-five years of active lawmaking has not halted the decline of Canada’s ecosystems or environmental standing.</h4>
                    <p>Nothing says ‘Canada’ quite like a scenic vista—be it Gros Morne, the Saskatchewan sky, or a whale breeching in the Salish Sea. Canadians are justly proud of the vast variety of our landscapes. Our pride and concern for our natural environment has been rock-steady over a quarter of a century. Only Swiss and Norwegian citizens are more likely than Canadians to identify [off-site link op] the environment as their No. 1 political issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our leaders have appeared to be in step. Regardless of party, they have regularly assured us that Canada’s natural security is well protected. Legislation has been enacted <a href="/#card/chart-timeseries">across an impressive range of fronts</a>, from protecting species to penalizing polluters and preventing foreseeable harm.

                        Yet independent assessments and a candid account of our history tell [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] quite a different story. Much of this country’s original wealth was created by logging forests for timber, breaking native prairie for grain fields, and blasting minerals from hard rock. The idea that environmental loss is a regrettable but necessary price for prosperity has been deeply engrained. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister justified inaction in defense of a stable climate with the argument that, “No country is going to take actions that are going to deliberately destroy jobs and growth in their country.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That this conventional wisdom is wrong is one of the clearest signals to emerge from a review of the past quarter-century. To the contrary, a growing body of evidence underscores the very large economic benefits that flow from healthy ecosystems, and the correspondingly high cost of their loss or disruption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Significantly, as the value of the security these natural systems provide has come more sharply into focus since the turn of the century, Canada’s standing on environmental stewardship has slipped from near the top of the class among developed countries, to near or even at the very bottom.
                    </p>

                        We examined the actions that Canada’s governments—of differing political stripes—have taken to protect and secure the environment since 1989, as well as the global context of those actions. Over this extended period, we found that state-of-the-art legislation to protect biodiversity, the safety of air and water, and critical natural systems, has never been fully implemented or effectively enforced. Numerous mandated goals remain unmet.

                        The consequences of bi-partisan neglect are now becoming apparent. Many supposedly ‘protected’ species are at greater risk [Sci2 – Report Card repeating format series: text bullets of hilites of Enviro Commish Rep’ts] today than they were in 1989. New and more elusive chemical threats have replaced older biological ones in Canada’s water—although some of the latter are also back with a vengeance.
                        Ambitious goals articulated a quarter-century ago to reduce Canada’s climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions have slipped by unmet. [CC1 – x/y GHG emissions over time; + two target lines] Our contributions to climate change [BL Section 4 climate] continue to rise even as its manifestations take a growing toll on livelihoods and structures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elsewhere, international investors and key agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund now question the conventional Canadian wisdom that expanding the economy is worth any price to the environment. Bodies that report [WLD 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] on how well different countries’ are maintaining their natural security have made the same link.

                    <h3>From ‘A’s to ‘F’s</h3>
                    <p>
                        Such rankings are only as old as the new century. One of the earliest was completed in 2000 as a pilot project for the World Economic Forum. Combining 64 indicators, the Yale Centre for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science ranked Canada 7th [WLD 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] among 56 developed and developing countries. In a more polished version the next year, Canada scored even better: [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] third in a field of 122.

                    <p>
                        But more critical assessments surfaced almost at once. In the same year that Yale and Columbia placed Canada third in the world, researchers at the University of Victoria called [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] Canada’s environmental record, “one of the poorest of the industrialized countries." In follow-up comparisons, the same team ranked Canada 28th among 30 wealthy countries in 2005 [Wld-2 ‘Report Card’ Series], and 24th of 25 in 2010 [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other assessments have arrived at the same unflattering conclusion: against other developed countries, Canada trails. The United Nations Environment Program put us as low as 43th [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] in the world in environmental “vulnerability” in 2005. The business-oriented Conference Board of Canada has similarly scored us near the bottom of our peer group: at 15th among 17 countries as recently as 2013 [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series]. And last year the Centre for Global Development put us right at the very bottom: [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] 27th in a field of 27 rich, educated nations.

                    <h5 class="clearfix">Not how we see ourselves</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our national decline in global stewardship rankings is at odds with Canadians’ views over the same years as captured in opinion polls [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels] (although the same surveys reveal we have always been skeptical that our governments were up to the job).</p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 1989, more than four-fifths of Canadians polled by Environics Research agreed at least somewhat (and fully half of us “strongly”) that pollution, “threatens the very survival of the human race.” More than nine in ten of us were at least somewhat concerned [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels] about specific issues like acid rain, toxic chemicals, air and water quality, with concern for wildlife close behind. Climate change even then was on the minds of eight Canadians in ten.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, Canadians were roughly split on whether the federal government was doing a “fair” job protecting the environment, or a “poor” one. Four in ten nonetheless optimistically believed the environment would improve over the following decade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nearly a dozen years later, further research by the same group revealed that public concern about threats like toxic chemicals, water quality and wildlife had hardly changed. [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels] Confidence in the federal government was up modestly: by 2001 more than half of Canadians felt it was doing a “fair” job; only 29% rated it “poor.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The financial crisis that struck in 2008 dramatically changed Canadians’ priorities. [Sci 9 – x/y showing change in opinions pre-post 2008] The year before, polls had placed the environment in a statistical tie with health care as the country’s most important problem in citizens’ eyes. By the following year, it had dropped to a distant third, buried by worry over the economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There has been a corresponding drop-off in pollsters’ interest in Canadians’ environmental views, but a handful of studies confirm that concern hasn’t lessened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Late last year Environics found [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels]that while more Canadians identified the economy as the country’s #1 issue “right now”, when they considered the future, environment degradation led as the biggest anticipated threat to security. Other research found that while Canadians’ have become more certain that human activity is causing climate change, their confidence in government to be the “lead actor” in response, has dropped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short: Canadians’ concern for the environment has changed little over 25 years. Governments claim to have taken effective action. Yet our grades are dropping. Below, we explore this paradox in detail.

                    <h3>Falling Grades</h3>
                    <h4>Twenty-five years of active lawmaking has not halted the decline of Canada’s ecosystems or environmental standing.</h4>
                    <p>Nothing says ‘Canada’ quite like a scenic vista—be it Gros Morne, the Saskatchewan sky, or a whale breeching in the Salish Sea. Canadians are justly proud of the vast variety of our landscapes. Our pride and concern for our natural environment has been rock-steady over a quarter of a century. Only Swiss and Norwegian citizens are more likely than Canadians to identify [off-site link op] the environment as their No. 1 political issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our leaders have appeared to be in step. Regardless of party, they have regularly assured us that Canada’s natural security is well protected. Legislation has been enacted <a href="/#card/chart-timeseries">across an impressive range of fronts</a>, from protecting species to penalizing polluters and preventing foreseeable harm.

                        Yet independent assessments and a candid account of our history tell [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] quite a different story. Much of this country’s original wealth was created by logging forests for timber, breaking native prairie for grain fields, and blasting minerals from hard rock. The idea that environmental loss is a regrettable but necessary price for prosperity has been deeply engrained. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister justified inaction in defense of a stable climate with the argument that, “No country is going to take actions that are going to deliberately destroy jobs and growth in their country.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That this conventional wisdom is wrong is one of the clearest signals to emerge from a review of the past quarter-century. To the contrary, a growing body of evidence underscores the very large economic benefits that flow from healthy ecosystems, and the correspondingly high cost of their loss or disruption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Significantly, as the value of the security these natural systems provide has come more sharply into focus since the turn of the century, Canada’s standing on environmental stewardship has slipped from near the top of the class among developed countries, to near or even at the very bottom.
                    </p>

                        We examined the actions that Canada’s governments—of differing political stripes—have taken to protect and secure the environment since 1989, as well as the global context of those actions. Over this extended period, we found that state-of-the-art legislation to protect biodiversity, the safety of air and water, and critical natural systems, has never been fully implemented or effectively enforced. Numerous mandated goals remain unmet.

                        The consequences of bi-partisan neglect are now becoming apparent. Many supposedly ‘protected’ species are at greater risk [Sci2 – Report Card repeating format series: text bullets of hilites of Enviro Commish Rep’ts] today than they were in 1989. New and more elusive chemical threats have replaced older biological ones in Canada’s water—although some of the latter are also back with a vengeance.
                        Ambitious goals articulated a quarter-century ago to reduce Canada’s climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions have slipped by unmet. <a href="/#card/chart-timeseries">[CC1 – x/y GHG emissions over time; + two target lines]</a> Our contributions to climate change [BL Section 4 climate] continue to rise even as its manifestations take a growing toll on livelihoods and structures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elsewhere, international investors and key agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund now question the conventional Canadian wisdom that expanding the economy is worth any price to the environment. Bodies that report [WLD 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] on how well different countries’ are maintaining their natural security have made the same link.

                        Such rankings are only as old as the new century. One of the earliest was completed in 2000 as a pilot project for the World Economic Forum. Combining 64 indicators, the Yale Centre for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science ranked Canada 7th [WLD 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] among 56 developed and developing countries. In a more polished version the next year, Canada scored even better: [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] third in a field of 122.

                        But more critical assessments surfaced almost at once. In the same year that Yale and Columbia placed Canada third in the world, researchers at the University of Victoria called [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] Canada’s environmental record, “one of the poorest of the industrialized countries." In follow-up comparisons, the same team ranked Canada 28th among 30 wealthy countries in 2005 [Wld-2 ‘Report Card’ Series], and 24th of 25 in 2010 [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other assessments have arrived at the same unflattering conclusion: against other developed countries, Canada trails. The United Nations Environment Program put us as low as 43th [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] in the world in environmental “vulnerability” in 2005. The business-oriented Conference Board of Canada has similarly scored us near the bottom of our peer group: at 15th among 17 countries as recently as 2013 [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series]. And last year the Centre for Global Development put us right at the very bottom: [Wld 2 ‘Report Card’ Series] 27th in a field of 27 rich, educated nations.

                    <h5 class="clearfix">Not how we see ourselves</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our national decline in global stewardship rankings is at odds with Canadians’ views over the same years as captured in opinion polls [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels] (although the same surveys reveal we have always been skeptical that our governments were up to the job).</p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 1989, more than four-fifths of Canadians polled by Environics Research agreed at least somewhat (and fully half of us “strongly”) that pollution, “threatens the very survival of the human race.” More than nine in ten of us were at least somewhat concerned [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels] about specific issues like acid rain, toxic chemicals, air and water quality, with concern for wildlife close behind. Climate change even then was on the minds of eight Canadians in ten.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, Canadians were roughly split on whether the federal government was doing a “fair” job protecting the environment, or a “poor” one. Four in ten nonetheless optimistically believed the environment would improve over the following decade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nearly a dozen years later, further research by the same group revealed that public concern about threats like toxic chemicals, water quality and wildlife had hardly changed. [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels] Confidence in the federal government was up modestly: by 2001 more than half of Canadians felt it was doing a “fair” job; only 29% rated it “poor.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The financial crisis that struck in 2008 dramatically changed Canadians’ priorities. [Sci 9 – x/y showing change in opinions pre-post 2008] The year before, polls had placed the environment in a statistical tie with health care as the country’s most important problem in citizens’ eyes. By the following year, it had dropped to a distant third, buried by worry over the economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There has been a corresponding drop-off in pollsters’ interest in Canadians’ environmental views, but a handful of studies confirm that concern hasn’t lessened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Late last year Environics found [Sci 10 – x/y showing change in opinion levels]that while more Canadians identified the economy as the country’s #1 issue “right now”, when they considered the future, environment degradation led as the biggest anticipated threat to security. Other research found that while Canadians’ have become more certain that human activity is causing climate change, their confidence in government to be the “lead actor” in response, has dropped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short: Canadians’ concern for the environment has changed little over 25 years. Governments claim to have taken effective action. Yet our grades are dropping. Below, we explore this paradox in detail.

                    <h3>About This Project</h3>
                    <p>The Tyee Solutions Society is a Canadian non-profit association supported by philanthropic funding that uses traditional investigative techniques and innovative technological approaches to provide citizens with the information they need to create positive change. Its previous work has included new approaches to aboriginal education and practical ideas for ‘greening’ Canada’s oil sands. [links to respective landing pages]</p>
                    <p>This series was produced by the Tyee Solutions Society (TSS) in collaboration with Tides Canada Initiatives, with funding from the Gencon Foundation. Tides Canada Initiatives and the Gencon Foundation neither influence nor endorse the particular content of TSS' reporting and guarantee its full editorial autonomy. If you wish to re-publish this story or any other TSS-produced article, please contact Chris Wood [TSS email link].</p>

                    <p>This TSS assignment asked a deceptively simple question: Cutting through all partisan rhetoric, how well has Canada cared for its environment, really?</p>

                    <p>The result is a ‘just the facts ma’am’ record of the best answers we could find. To make our report the most objective one possible without conducting prohibitively expensive original science, we spent 10 months combing the most reliable publically available sources: government documents, scientific papers, reports from independent international bodies, leading research and think-tank organizations. To help overcome a potential bias toward only the most recent activities, we examined a full quarter-century of Canada’s environmental record—a period during which five Prime Ministers from three parties [eds: counting PCs and Cs as different] occupied 24 Sussex Drive.</p>

                    <p>This method had some weaknesses. Some older and formerly public government reports have become difficult to obtain as a result of changes to archiving policy. Continuous records of key environmental variables are in any case few (as many of the reports we reviewed also observed). Some information simply did not exist in 1989. Evidence-based ranking of countries’ environmental stewardship dates only to 2000. In other cases time liberated information that might once have been locked behind proprietary walls—such as detailed polling results.</p>

                    <p>The search produced hundreds of individual records, across six environmental dimensions, covering the entire period chronologically. These records, with links to their sources, can be found here [LINK TK]; we hope other researchers find them of use. We have made every effort to confirm the accuracy of each of these, but do not guarantee it all cases. For some earlier events, dates are best approximations. We will be grateful to have errors brought to our attention.</p>

                    <p>We are also grateful to the Environmental Law Centre at the University of Victoria for its assistance in identifying and providing analysis of key legislative and judicial developments since 1989, and to Evidence for Democracy for data relating to government support for science.</p>

                    <p>Chris Wood was the primary researcher on this project and wrote the main text. David Beers supervised the research and edited the text. Phillip Smith created the underlying website technology. Alex Grunenfelder styled the many infographics. Carra Simpson administered the project. [other credits??]</p>

                    <p>This report is novel not only in its examination of a full quarter-century of federal stewardship of the world’s second-largest land mass, but in being tailored from inception to reach Canadians in every way that they seek out knowledge in the 21st century. We hope it becomes a place where Canadians using any device can go to answer for themselves how well their country has cared for any aspect of the environment that concerns them.</p>

                    <p>We ourselves draw no broader conclusion than this to the general question we were asked: “How well has Canada cared for its environment, really?” Sadly, not very well.</p>
