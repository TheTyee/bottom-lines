However, when the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans released a SARA plan to protect the whales’ critical habitat, it committed only to protect geophysical features such as shorelines and seabeds against damage by activities like pile-driving, sea-bed trawl fishing and ships’ anchors, arguing that other attributes are up to the minister's discretion to protect under other legislation. Nine environmental groups took the Crown to court. The Federal Court of Appeal agrees that SARA obliges the minister to protect all the habitat elements critical to the survival of threatened and endangered species—including factors such food prey—and that the Minister of Fisheries acted “unlawfully” in substituting discretionary action under other legislation for such a plan.

Caribou are listed as threatened under the Act, and in Alberta are negatively impacted by the fragmentation of their habitat, principally due to resource developments, and further by the increased predation by wolves it makes possible. The Minister of the Environment concluded that an emergency protection order was unnecessary, because the caribou faced only local extirpation and not an imminent threat to their survival or recovery as a species. The Court accepts the evidence of injury to the caribou population, but also finds that the minister may have reached his conclusion reasonably—however he did not adequately explain that reasoning.

However, when the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans released a SARA plan to protect the whales’ critical habitat, it committed only to protect geophysical features such as shorelines and seabeds against damage by activities like pile-driving, sea-bed trawl fishing and ships’ anchors, arguing that other attributes are up to the minister's discretion to protect under other legislation. Nine environmental groups took the Crown to court. The Federal Court of Appeal agrees that SARA obliges the minister to protect all the habitat elements critical to the survival of threatened and endangered species—including factors such food prey—and that the Minister of Fisheries acted “unlawfully” in substituting discretionary action under other legislation for such a plan.

This would destroy a watercourse, requiring approval under the federal Fisheries Act and triggering an impact assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 1992). The federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans limited the scope of the assessment to the impacts on the watercourse, excluding the broader impacts of the project as a whole on other interests within federal jurisdiction such as migratory birds, indigenous peoples and fisheries. The Prairie Acid Rain Coalition, an environmental group, challenged that exclusion before the Federal Court, which ruled in favour of the ministry. Its decision allowed the federal government to significantly narrow the scope of environmental assessments, and was arguably at odds with several earlier rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada.

However the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, citing the 2006 ‘TrueNorth’ decision, 'scoped' the proposal under review to include only a tailings pond dam, a relatively minor feature requiring only a 'screening' without public consultation; it excluded from review the mine itself and an associated ore mill--the elements of the project which met the criteria for more stringent study. MiningWatch, a non-profit group, challenged this decision. The case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court of Canada, which rules that the Department does not have the legal right to redefine or 'split' development projects so as to reduce the level of environmental scrutiny they attract. The Court rules that a CEAA 1992 review may go beyond the impacts of a proposed project considered in full, but may not be restricted to less.
